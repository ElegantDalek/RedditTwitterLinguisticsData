r/funny,That's sooo sweet
r/funny,"If you think that's dedication, you should see what Mickey did when a kid shat himself."
r/funny,"I went in a wheelchair a few years ago. DH and I came across Stitch at a point where everyone else had just walked away. We got waved in, took photos, because, hey, why the hell not? Stitch ended up taking my wheelchair and RUNNING with me while I cracked the hell up and his handler started half-yelling at... He ended up giving me a push into the gift shop at full costumed speed. We thought it was hilarious."
r/funny,"I find that kids cry if you react nervously, by mimicking the action with that smile facing her it made her  feel better about it"
r/funny,Obviously fell over while laughing. In stitches.
r/funny,Further evidence that Stitch is worthy Disney Princess.
r/funny,Soooo what if I rip my shirt off running up to Cinderella?
r/funny,"A big thank you to everyone that works at Disney World! I've taken my family twice. Both times everyone was so thoughtful and kind. Your job definitely isn't an easy one but your delightful attitudes are something we will always remember and support Disney! FYI, my kids still talk about small things like the lady making sundaes and giving them a comically huge bowl because they said please and thank you!"
r/funny,I have many friends who work at Disney in California and I can tell you that they really don't make much money at all. Many of them struggle paycheck to paycheck but they truly care about their jobs and the smiles it brings to kids and even adults. Stitch here used quick thinking on the spot and probably made her whole day.
r/funny,Stitch needs a raise!
r/funny,It's gotta be fun as hell being one of those characters every day. The fun I would have. Then again with my luck I would get assigned the costume that has puke in the mask.
r/funny,Some of the people in those suits earn their money and then some.
r/funny,More like /aww than /funny
r/funny,"Ohana means family, family means nobody gets left behind"
r/funny,Who ever is in that stitch costume is the smartest and nicest person ever. He/She realized  that the little girl fell over and made them feel happy
r/funny,Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten. (Someone had to)
r/funny,"I don't know who this Stitch fella is, but that's cute."

r/funny,That was really adorable but I‚Äôm sorry...that aggressive ground tackle made me laugh probably too hard (and I may have rewatched it approx 6 times)
r/funny,The nicest angel you have
r/funny,This Stitch is a little taller than I remember.
r/funny,Very wholesome
r/funny,Reminds me of the band Paramore with a fan of theirs at a show. https://youtu.be/TStxYGzmo-Q
r/funny,She did eat shit aww
r/funny,That‚Äôs actually really heartwarming
r/funny,"Damn, what a faceplant. 5/7, would watch again"
r/funny,I always love the exaggerated movements they make in those costumes

r/funny,"While I personally hate The Mouse and all the shit that company does, I will give them credit for this. The management did one thing right with their characters and the people that play them. They really, truly are there to make sure that there's magic in everything they do. I have massive respect for that part of the company."
r/funny,:( she even rubs her knee :(
r/funny,The Stitch guy probably fell down from laughter üòÇ

r/funny,"Kids just cosplaying the movie to perfection. 

There was a time I hated this movie. It‚Äôs all my niece ever watched when she was a toddler. And there‚Äôs this thing that Lilo does where she falls flat onto her face flailing and screaming like a demon thrown into a tub of holy water when she doesn‚Äôt get her way.  

Well my little niece learned that trick. And used it liberally."
r/funny,"lol nice.  or he was jealous that the kid would get all the attention and be like ""not on my watch!"""
r/funny,Awww!  That‚Äôs awesome of them
r/funny,SNIPER IN THE PINK CASTLE
r/funny,Omg I love Stitch
r/funny,He might need a stitch or two after that rough fall.

r/funny,I used to deliver and merchandise for Pepsi. It always blew my mind how nobody really ask for credentials. Sometimes I would forget my uniform in a new store and just walk to the back area and load up a cart. I could have easily walked out with U-boats full of merch. Doesn't help that most of the staff simply doesn't give a fuck.
r/funny,"My teacher always taught us that you can get away with anything with enough confidence. 

When he was in college, him and his friends walked into a local sporting goods store, grabbed a canoe and walked straight out. When they past an employee, they asked him to help them load it into their car, and he did."
r/funny,Modern problems require modern solutions
r/funny,At my pre koi‚Äôs job a guy did this weigh our vending machines.   He walked in with a clipboard and handtruck with a uniform on.  He can in and said he was here to pick up our old vending machines and new ones would be installed the following day.  To add to it one of the other mechanics asked the guy if he needed help gettin into his truck and the guy said sure.  So now my co-worker is helping the guy load the vending machines he is stealing into the box truck.   A couple days later the real owner of the vending machines came to refill them and was not happy to learn what happened.   It was great watching the surveillance video of my co-worker out there with the guy.   All you have to do is play the part and look the part and nobody is going to question you.
r/funny,90 percent of getting in is looking like you belong there.
r/funny,I'm here for a massive beer recall.
r/funny,You'd think coming in and out of the front door instead of the loading bay would be a red flag to someone.
r/funny,He didn't steal beer. He stole Bud Light.
r/funny,Fake it till you make it
r/funny,Description correction.  Steals cases of water.
r/funny,When I worked for Red Bull we had a guy get fake shirts online and hit stores all over the San Fran Bay Area doing this.  He hit a winco in my territory for 29 cases over $1000 in product.  The store had no idea until the next day when I arrived and told them it was gone. The video showed him wheel it out the front door with one of their carts.  That  one made waves.
r/funny,"Before 911, there was a British skit, where a guy with a hi-viz vest and a 6 foot A-frame ladder gains access to all sorts of places with no ID.  Boats, hotels, weddings, just walked right in, no one batted an eye."
r/funny,"I mean I‚Äôm not going to say he isn‚Äôt wrong, but I get it"
r/funny,Agent 47 is that you?!
r/funny,why would a delivery person be removing product?
r/funny,This happened years ago -- did they ever find this guy?
r/funny,B+ for cunning! And A+ for fashion!
r/funny,Sneak 100
r/funny,"Meanwhile, my store has called security on two different sets of company reps (tbf the two kombucha reps looked like university frat boys), and caught at least one dude trying to make off with cases of RedBull that way..."
r/funny,He's not the Hero we deserve. He's the Hero we need
r/funny,The akward moment when you realise that the person looking as the usual guy is the culprit not the shady one inside the store.
r/funny,A god among men
r/funny,"Sneak level 100, Charisma level 100."
r/funny,Dude had a thousand lies and a good disguise.
r/funny,Police man disguised as a delivery driver.

r/funny,"A friend of mine worked in a large sporting goods store. One day two guys walked out the front door with a canoe. They walked right by all the cashiers, loaded it on their truck and drove away."

r/funny,Wasn‚Äôt there a Miller commercial where the Miller delivery guy went in and pulled out other beer?

r/funny,He stole Bud Light with all those options? What a fuckin tool.
r/funny,"Calling Bud Light ""beer"" is a bit of a stretch there, no?"
r/funny,OK here‚Äôs a hint - I DID post it so many people may assume that‚Äôs what I think but I‚Äôll leave you guessing. Good luck

r/funny,"""WERE YOU SMOKING MARIJUANA!?""

""No no! I drank a bottle of whiskey, smoked a pack of cigs, ate a box of KFC and this morning took 3 Advil to deal with it.""

""OH....ok then. Good."""
r/funny,On a Sunday?
r/funny,It's good to be in Canada
r/funny,"The fact that employers in the US are even allowed to do this boggle my mind. Americans, who proselytize on the merits of personal freedom above all, seem to think this is somehow normal."
r/funny,"Sure, if you want to lose a third of your workforce in one day."
r/funny,Test away losers I live in Oregon and don't have a job. Suck it
r/funny,Jokes on them I studied
r/funny,I was an early casualty during the very first round off government testing of urinalysis tests on the military. On my goddamn birthday no less. George Bush Sr decided to do this back in the Reagan era.
r/funny,"Oh, so national ""entrap and fire 1/4 of your staff all at once what could possibly be a negative outcome of that  ha ha gottem"" day."
r/funny,"Jokes on you I work for myself, and I wouldn't do that to me."
r/funny,"Hahaha let's all joke about the further involvement of corporations in your private life. 

Never forget that these drug tests don't catch heroin, meth, cocaine, or any of the hard drugs. Those are out of your system in 24 to 72 hours. Cannabis can last over a month. 

If an employer wants your piss tell that boss to open their mouth."
r/funny,"From a management perspective, unless your employees are handling heavy equipment, this would be suicide for a business. Losing &gt;40% of your workforce at once would be difficult to recover from."
r/funny,"But it's Easter, the Bible says he has risen and their shall be no drug tests today. I'm paraphrasing but you get the jest."
r/funny,Truth is alcohol and people who are hung over are an huge burden on the work place.  Alcohol abuse should be shamed more than the weed consumption
r/funny,"I used to smoke a hell of a lot of weed back in my 20's,  I still do, but I used to also."
r/funny,"I Gotta take a whiz test to my P.O.

I know I failed, ‚Äòcause I done smoked

Major weed, bro"
r/funny,Is it a suprise when you have a day named after it?
r/funny,*laughs in Canadian*
r/funny,Good thing it's Sunday
r/funny,It‚Äôs a Sunday
r/funny,Easter = both my jobs are closed today
r/funny,Jokes on you I‚Äôm unemployed.  *hits blunt*

r/funny,4/22: National Unemployment Day
r/funny,"Cool I got a high score on the random test, what do I win?"
r/funny,"We're you smoking pot?

Oh ok cool, that's a fine selection of snacks you have there.

-  try the ketchup chips."
r/funny,"Well, this year 4/22 is national surprise drug test day. ain't no one getting tested on a Sunday..."
r/funny,"Legal in Michigan now. As long as you are not visibly impaired at work, my employer does not care anymore."
r/funny,*Laughs in canadian*
r/funny,"It‚Äôs bizarre that the ‚Äúland of the free‚Äù allows random workplace drug testing. It‚Äôs a stunning invasion of privacy. Could see it in select cases for safety (eg airline pilots), but not anywhere.

r/funny,Who drug tests on a sunday?
r/funny,"Yeah, because my shop wants no employees left."
r/funny,Also national fake piss day
r/funny,Get ready people
r/funny,This is such a bad joke...
r/funny,What kind of drugs are we testing?
r/funny,It‚Äôs a Sunday...
r/funny,Jokes on you The government is closed on Sundays.
r/funny,"Jokes on you, it's a Sunday."
r/funny,"Ah well, tomorrow is 420 too"
r/funny,"Wouldnt it be 4/22 since both jobs and drug testing centers will generally be closed today, both because its a Sunday and easter"
r/funny,Luckily it‚Äôs legal country wide here in Canada.
r/funny,"Luckily, because it‚Äôs Easter, you could tell them that you were ‚Äúhigh on god‚Äù"
r/funny,"I'm glad they don't do generalized drug testing here in Canada.  I can't pee if someone's around me. 

It's also legal here now to smoke, though some jobs it's still illegal, like pilot, police etc.  I suppose for those jobs they might do testing but they don't do it for every job like in the US."
r/funny,"Random ‚Äúdrug‚Äù testing for cannabis is the result of decades of misinformation. 

2 government comities years apart concluded cannabis is not dangerous and should be decriminalized. 

Both times our own government chose to spread their own propaganda instead of embracing research and science that they themselves did. 

Frustrating. The correct dosage cannabis, given at the right times with food and drink can actually IMPROVE a person‚Äôs performance. 

I can‚Äôt wait for the day where this is encouraged."
r/funny,Good thing it‚Äôs Sunday and most clinics are closed
r/funny,It‚Äôs a Sunday and it‚Äôs Easter. And if your priest is giving you a piss test you have other problems.

r/funny,Would be surprised if someone would show up at my place on Sunday and demand me to pee in a cup.
r/funny,Not on a Sunday they won‚Äôt!
r/funny,"Except it‚Äôs sunday, and most testing labs aren‚Äôt open on the weekend."
r/funny,I was so blazed i came in the cup and asked if i would get money for donating
r/funny,"Nah not this year. It's Easter. And a Sunday. 

So pushed to 4/22."
r/funny,Not in Canada üòÅ

r/funny,This lame ass joke gets funnier every year I presume... that‚Äôs the one not reason I can think that‚Äôd ppl would still be posting this 50 years later
r/funny,Who cares if you're Canadian
r/funny,If it is a scheduled non monitored collection (most are for random UA's)  I *highly* recommend Quik Fixx.  It is a synthetic that I have used several times.
r/funny,"Who the fuck gets drug tested on a Sunday? Most people aren't at work, and if you are at work, I know your HR department isn't at work."
r/funny,Rest of the smoke oppressed world has this day on 21/04 instead.. Oh wait
r/funny,"That applies to me today ffs, was never controlled more than necessary in the aeroport, today had to wait for 30 mins while a guy checked every inch of my body (even between my legs) and a lady turned my luggage upside down while testing with some paper and putting it into a machine (probably for drugs or something).

Got questioned about my life and stuff like if i was a criminal.

Never happened to me in years of frequent travels."
r/funny,Are there even places where weed is still illegal?
r/funny,"Jokes on you, it‚Äôs Sunday."
r/funny,"Wow I‚Äôve never seen this before, much funny, much original, much laughs"

r/funny,That was unexpected
r/funny,was the entire post not screwed in?
r/funny,Me when I'm trying to fix literally anything.

She sat far back behind me so I didn't hear anything, and the next thing I know some muscle head is yelling for the bus driver to stop the bus and was manhandling an old mid 50s guy off the bus. Muscle head started yelling ""get this creep off the bus, he's back there kissing a passed out girl."" 

Although in 10 years taking the bus this is the most I've ever witnessed happen so the bus is genuinely a safe place to be."

Proceeded to strike up a conversation with me, telling me about how he was bitten by a dog, sued the owner, and used the money he got to buy the model. He even showed me both the bite wound and took the model out of its box to show me. A strange experience, but also quite interesting."

He also had his feet crossed in a way no old man would have. His hand were really pale and folded on his lap. I could not see him breathing. 

But the strangest thing was that the elderly man was holding the old man's head the whole time. Not gently, but really holding it with his two hands as if it would fall off. 

I still don't know if he was dead, a puppet or really sick. But it was somehow really scary."

r/askreddit,"I stayed in Istanbul for a month. During that time, I came to the conclusion that some women lean back to back to avoid harassment. 

My first encounter was very weird tho. It was very crowded and there were only two other girls there. Without saying anything, they wiggled their way to me and both leaned their back on my back. Not gonna lie, I was quite spooked. Haven't experienced it anywhere else.

Edit: To avoid further confusion, I want to add that I'm a girl."

r/askreddit,"Kinda late, but it would have to be DDLG role play. Both were mid-thirties and heavyset, dressed like middle school weabs and the lady even had a pacifier. She kept asking her ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù repeatedly, baby voice and all, if they were at the park yet. That‚Äôs not even the worse part of it, she would give her pacifier to her partner and he‚Äôd slob on it (heavily) and put it back in her mouth for her. And she would make this weird crooning noise. I‚Äôm shivering already just remembering."

Bonus - in the morning when we arrived and were leaving the train she winked at me."

r/askreddit,"I saw a guy (about 15 years old, chubby and always wearing a light blue T shirt) entering a bus line I was taking a few years ago (actually several times). When the bus stopped and the driver opened the door, he just stood there with his little suitcase, staring at me or another passanger and said ""Take my suitcase in"". No ""please"" no ""can you"" just a straight order. I thought that he had some kind of disability and that he couldn't carry heavy objects but once I grabbed his suitcase it was pretty light and as I said, he was not looking like a weak guy. I expect everyone to be able to do this on his/her own.

This happened several times and I have no explanaition why this guy always had his little suitcase with him and why he always wanted others to carry it for basically 1 foot and also why he was behaving this strangely."

r/askreddit,"About fifteen years ago I took a bus and a black woman sat next to me at the very back and asked me what I was reading. I was reading about the War of 1812 and she wanted to know everything about it. I was delighted to explain it to her.

After about ten minutes of pleasant conversation, she suddenly got up and said, ""Wait just one minute,"" then goes up to a young couple at the front of the bus who were speaking in Arabic.

Out of nowhere she started screaming at them and saying they were responsible for 9/11, that they were terrorists, literal pieces of shit, etc. Everyone was shocked (this was in Toronto) and the man started yelling back. The driver strangely did nothing to stop the woman, and the couple got off as soon as they could.

Then, with everyone on the bus staring at her, the woman walked back to the seat next to me and tried to resume our conversation about the War of 1812 as if nothing had occurred."

She opened her bag, took out  a sandwich (that kind that you get in 7/11), opened it and started eating it, also she took out a juice box, put the straw in it and started drinking. She enjoyed half her sandwich before she noticed that her stop was coming. She wrapped the sandwich carefully, put the juice box and the sandwich in the plastic bag, stood up and left.

All without help from anybody, without making a mess, carefully and gracefully. With no hands. Using what Nature gave her and with no expression of self pity or anything like that. She was the master of her life."
r/askreddit,"Saw an elderly, homeless woman get up from her seat, start yelling and screaming. Then start stripping. Unfortunately I couldn't get off the train to switch cars because she was blocking one end and the conductor was at the other end.

They proceeded to vandalise almost every seat on the bus while one of the tweens burnt his leg purposely with a lighter. Another time a bloke asked me for spare change and I gave him a five dollar note- he sang me a long about beautiful blue eyes (I have brown eyes).

r/askreddit,"I have posted this story once before. It got buried then and probably will again but here is my weird and disgusting story from the tube (London Underground):

On a relatively busy underground carriage an obviously tired professional looking lady drifted of to sleep in her seat. At the next stop a guy gets on the train who is clearly homeless, has a bad hacking cough and is also carrying a pungent odour with him. He sits in the chair opposite the sleeping lady and this is when his hacking cough becomes more noticeable. A few minutes later he coughs so violently a globule of what is either sputum or saliva lands on the lapel of the sleeping lady. Homeless guy gets of at the next stop and now the whole train carriage is looking at the sputum on the ladies jacket.

Well she finally jerks awake and the first thing she notices is everyone staring at her. She is obviously taken aback by this and quickly tries to figure out why we are all looking. That's when she notices the saliva/phlegm. She must've thought that she was drooling when she slept because instead of cleaning it off with a tissue she decided the best course of action would be to quickly and discreetly use her mouth. She darted her eyes around the carriage and then as if in slow motion she lifted the lapel up to her lips and quickly sucked up the sputum/saliva globule.

We all wanted to stop her but none of us did. She acted so quickly there was nothing we could do to stop her. Before she had actually noticed the saliva we are all being terribly British and refusing to break the no talking on the tube rule. Just hoping she wouldn't notice it or if she did notice she would just wipe it off with a tissue. After she had sucked up the phlegm it was too late to say anything and we all wordlessly agreed it was better to let her continue believing that it was her own saliva/sputum."

r/askreddit,"I was on a train one afternoon coming home from work on a wet and windy winters day. 
As the train pulled into the next train station I could see all the people on the platform with their coats on and standing under their umbrellas as the train went passed them slowing to a stop. 
As the train stopped I noticed a guy on the platform, about six foot tall, wearing a way to small, torn and tattered flannelette shirt. It fit him like a crop top, he had no shirt underneath and the only other thing he was wearing was a sock.. A sock that was tied around his unbelievably massive dick. 
He was just standing there with his arms crossed shivering in the cold with a sock tied around his giant dick. Either completely oblivous to everyone looking at him in shock or he just didn't give a shit."

r/askreddit,"This is on the F train in NYC. Naturally.

A homeless guy gets on the train at some random stop, proceeds to sit down like a normal, not-so-well-adjusted homeless dude, talking to himself. As soon as the train starts moving, he drops his pants and takes a shit on the seat. Everyone around him seems to be intentionally looking in every other direction and pretending it didn't happen.

Naturally, the homeless dude pulls out a notebook and a sharpie and writes ""Please Do Not Thank You"" (no, I did NOT accidentally a word there -- that is exactly what he wrote) on the paper, rips out the page, then places the paper over his fresh shit on the seat.

He got off the train at the next stop.

The guy then takes off, and tries to hop on the train but it doesn't take off because the operator saw it happen. He closed the doors so he couldn't get out. Two cops ran by about 2 minutes after it happened. Ran up to the car he was in, got the doors opened and arrested him. He was screaming all kinds of shit, saying the cops were racist for arresting him, that this woman deserved it."

Well that was all well and good until the bus came to a point where he wanted to go left, but the bus route went right, the guy started freaking out because he had lost control of the bus ""AHHHHHHHHHHHH WE'RE ALL GONNA DIEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!"" and started rolling about on the floor and freaking the fuck out.

r/askreddit,"I was on a minibus in Sierra Leone (they don‚Äôt have public transport as in a regular bus service, per se. Instead if you‚Äôre travelling on your own or with a friend you can flag down just about anyone with a motorbike and ask if they‚Äôll take you to some destination. You arrange the price before you set off. If you‚Äôre travelling in a large group you just go to the local petrol station and there‚Äôll be a horde of minibuses waiting there to take you somewhere).

There‚Äôs 4 or 5 rows of seats in these things and they cram about 6-7 people per row (safety isn‚Äôt a thing there haha). My friends and I were going somewhere about 3-4 hours away and after a couple of hours, where we hadn‚Äôt stopped for anything. All of a sudden, a chicken lets out the loudest cluck I‚Äôve ever heard. On the other end of the same row I was in, there was a chicken in a cage covered by a sheet or a blanket and I hadn‚Äôt seen it and it had kept quiet all that time.

Everyone knows a public commuter like that. So, Dude is humming a tune but as he passes the first person, he says ""Duck"" and touches the top of their head. ""Tap"". It's gross. He continues in a
 predictable manner as everyone tries to dodge his awful hobo hand of God. ""Duck 'Tap', duck 'tap', duck 'tap', duck 'tap', duck 'tap' "", he repeats this mantra as he molests scalps. He touches your head and you feel microbes leave his finger tips and invade your head. So things are getting intense because no one knows what's going to happen when he reaches the back of the train since there's this big Zulu thug sitting at the end of the train with a I-wish-you-would expression on his face and Bruce Lee's master is in the middle of the coach already. It's like Russian Roulette after the trigger's been pulled for the fourth time. Anyway, frail dude is busy ducking all the passengers and time's finally up. Zulu guy, who's probably about 55 and probably fought along side Mandela in ANC, is confronted by the super ancient dude. It's awkward and intense and a stare off is underway. Now, I already got my frontal lobe blessed by this guy, so I'm waiting for the Zulu guy to get his. Old guy raises his hand like a priest. The word that we anticipate is about to come out, he gets the first syllable out, ""GOO..."" and WACK!!!! Zulu guy strikes him with the power of Shaka Zulu.

r/askreddit,"A close friend of mine had a video of him leaked in a wrestling outfit jacking himself off with a dildo and doing some butt stuff with it. It was like 4 minutes long, his face was clearly in it, anyone watching could tell it was him. We were 16 at the time, and the video was at least 2 years old, so there were red flags all over. Friend's dad worked at the school as well as the orchestra teacher, and this is the kind of stuff kids kill themselves over, so we were worried and didn't want this getting out.

I'm a scrawny dude so I went and grabbed my more intimidating friend and we followed the ""share trail"" back to the first person at our school to find it, and made SURE everyone who had seen it wasn't going to say anything. We tracked it back to a single gay porn tumblr account that had posted it. Most of it was 18+ content, but there were a few ""models"" that didn't really look over 18 at all. I contacted the owner and threatened to report them to the FBI for distributing child pornography, and that dude practically cleared his blog of all content he was so scared. Contacted tumblr staff on the side and they eventually shut the whole thing down. 

According to the tumblr dude, he had been sent the video by a woman who said she had permission, as this was her boyfriend, and he was over 18 (he looked like a child in the video, no way someone could mistake him for being over 18). We figured out the ""woman"" was our friend's ex, a former senior at the school who had apparently shared it as part of revenge porn. She had moved across the country after she graduated the year prior so there wasn't much we could do, but another close friend of ours had dated her and somehow her nudes got anonymously sent to her parents. Weird coincidence. 

Friend had no idea any of this happened at all and still doesn't to this day. Not sure if I'm ever gonna tell him. The two of us managed to squash the entire thing before more than 5 people at our school got ahold of it, and we went out of our way to berate people trying to spread the rumor."
r/askreddit,"I never told her but I know this girl from high school and I seen a video of her online. I only recognized her by the tattoo above her breasts, and honestly I'm very open minded and may have said something to her if it wasn't so goofy but in the video she holds up a cupcake and says ""this is how I eat a cupcake"" and then proceeds to stuff the cupcake into her pussy while saying ""nom nom nom"".

Halfway through, specifically at the point any viewer would be enjoying the video enough that they're not turning it off, I show up bouncing on my bed, fully clothed, screaming with a pillow cover on my head and dancing to the music in the club scene in the first Blade movie. After 30s, we cut back to the blonde as if nothing happened."
r/askreddit,"Not sure if this counts, but I used to post nudes on Tumblr and also on a local gay forum's NSFW thread during my ""formative"" years (aka horny and single). I've had closeted classmates writing to me, in good faith, letting me know that ""somebody leaked my nudes"". I'd thank them and say it's alright, I was the one who uploaded them.

I grew up in a conservative Asian country and was probably the only out gay guy in my university class, so it's always kinda fun to see people DM/PM-ing me on the forum and go like ""oh I think I know who you are!"".

One tried to blackmail me. I asked him to write that on sandpaper and shove it up his own arse."
r/askreddit,"I had a nude tumblr up until the porn ban. The first nude I ever posted I submitted anonymously to a body positivity blog.

r/askreddit,"When I was 15 I was sexting with someone on the internet one night and sent some dick and body pics. With half of my face in one of them because I‚Äôm a fucking idiot. 

Totally forgot about it for months. Then somebody in my school posted a link to one of the pictures I had sent to another person anonymously on some questions website. Turned out the person I was sexting had posted it on tumblr or something. 

Luckily it didn‚Äôt become a giant school-wide scandal but all of my friend group found out about it and saw the picture. And the kicker is that it outed me. 

I can tell ya that I really sympathized with J Law when the fappening happened. I like my dick and everything and I liked my body but there‚Äôs something that makes you feel very vulnerable knowing that the people you interact with have seen you like that when you haven‚Äôt seem them like that. I felt like a pedo or something. Like no matter what I did, they‚Äôd always remember that thing about me."
r/askreddit,"Not quite what you're asking about here but when I was 20ish I found out a friend of mine was gay when he showed me a picture of me that showed up on his porn forum. It had been fairly convincingly photoshopped from a shirtless modeling shot that someone had somehow gotten a hold of (from the photographer I assume, since my copies we're lower resolution). At least they gave me a monster dong and improved my abs. In the shot I looked a bit like Ryan Phillipe and I assume the ""artist"" mistook me for him. Said friend later tried to grind on me when I crashed on his couch after a night of drinking and told me how many times he had fantasized about me from that picture. Ended up sleeping in my car that night. We're not friends anymore."
r/askreddit,"Had a friend in HS who somehow met a girl online who he ended up vid chatting with; graphically. A few days later me and a bunch of people I know start getting friend requests on FB from a profile full of pictures of my friend beating his meat, face and all. Apparently this chick blackmailed him for $1000 and said if he didn‚Äôt pay she would do this and he didn‚Äôt believe her. He then tried to convince everyone that it was photoshop but nobody believed him. The profile was up for about a week or 2. I‚Äôm not sure how it ended, whether they paid or what, but it was really something."
r/askreddit,"A third perspective from someone who wasn't actively taking part in it. But was aware of it. 

My ex-girlfriend was a sensation a while on Reddit 

and it kinda went viral on other naughty boards / sites.

Back in those days I was aware of her online hobby

I didn't mind because they were rather tasteful, artful.

Besides it kinda made me proud

I don't see myself as this very attractive guy

Yet I was in relationship with this 'goddess' 

All those jealous guys were boosting my ego I guess

What spooked us both is how big and fast of a dedicated 'fanbase' she was gathering. 

And that was the end of it. 

It was crossing the boundaries between online and real life. 

""Is he just looking at my gf? or does he know?""

After a while our suspicion was bordering paranoia 

We both didn't like it anymore. It was negatively influencing our daily lives from that point

Thus the whole show stopped. They were getting really close of 'unmasking her' with comments such as

 ""Pretty sure she worked here and there a few years back"" 

Which were right.

Our biggest mistake was a short video clip. It had [music playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0b5NXZis_U) on the background (I was listening to music in another room) Which gave a way quite a lot. Our native language"
r/askreddit,"I did a very good job concealing my face.  If my friends would've seen them, they would either never bring it up out of the inevitable embarrassment of admitting they were browsing the sub I posted on, or they would print out the picture anonymously and hang it in a communal place where we could all see."

r/askreddit,"Not me, but when I signed up for Instagram a couple of years ago, all of my Facebook friends were automatically added. It turns out someone I kinda knew from high school had started taking some nude photos of herself in various public spots around my hometown and posting them to what she thought was a private account. I was a bit shocked at first because this woman was always very quiet when I knew her, and as far as I knew had been consistently dating the same guy since high school. 

In the end I decided to send her a DM to say ""Hey, this is awkward, but I just thought I'd let you know that your Instagram account is somehow linked to your Facebook account and automatically got added for me when I signed up."" - or something to that effect. She responded almost immediately to apologize and thank me for the heads up, and has since deleted her ""private"" account."
r/askreddit,"Wait, there are subs where people post their nudes???"
r/askreddit,"Not a partner. When i was in secondary school (year 10, 2008) a younger girl (year 8) posted a video of herself masturbating on youtube and shared it with her bf (or a friend im not sure) within a day or two it had spread to the ENTIRE school and people were openly watching and sharing it in class.

Needless to say... it was a massive scandal.

By the end of the week she had to move schools completely and the video had been removed from YouTube."
r/askreddit,"There's a fairly well known series of pictures when I was really sick (and bored) that made it around 4chan where I dressed my penis up as different things and drew faces with a sharpie on it while answering questions in character. This is like, shit, 8 or 10 years ago.

One buddy stumbled on it because I told him and died laughing and forwarded it to a bunch of our friends. I'm ""that"" dude though, the one with no shame so honestly I didn't give a shit and when the link pops up from time to time I still giggle. I haven't seen it in a while, and would like to find them again so I can show my now wife lol.

https://youtu.be/1EF6kB9q4vg"
r/askreddit,"I‚Äôm low-key bisexual and I‚Äôve posted on a handful of the male subreddits, and one time a guy from my university hit me up on here. I was a little scared since we‚Äôd worked for the same boss and he was in my professional sphere, but he turned out to be super sweet (and hot). 

We still chat once in a while, and I teased him for missing his chance when I lived there since he told me he‚Äôd check me out but never approached me. Cute guy, definitely a positive experience."
r/askreddit,"I used to sit with this smoking hot blonde girl named Shelby at lunch at work. She told me straight up she had her nudes on reddit. Saw them. They were gold. Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm autistic. If a girl tells you where to find her nudes does that mean she likes you? Prob not, right?"
r/askreddit,"Believe it or not, but I actually found out my ex was cheating on me via gonewild. I'd just started working about 80 miles away and was only home on weekends, so she started putting pictures on there for me. I'd never heard of it before. Anyway, I delved a bit deeper and found pictures of her with her boss's cock in her mouth, as well as threesomes pictures of her, her boss and a colleague of there's. That was a fun time. Funnily enough, I learnt I quite enjoy the idea of that, if sharing if you like, but the entire behind the back thig was entirely too much. So I'm gay now anyway, and she's come out as a transman, so I probably shouldn't be saying she. Anyway. Not many people know that story!"
r/askreddit,"I found my friends girlfriends account. They were pretty open, but he never wanted to be in any of the pictures. She also posted some pics with her gf. Anyway I never told her I saw them and she eventually took them down."

I absolutely hate to be 'that guy', that tells people what to do and has the moral high ground. But what I hate even more is people driving drunk, which is why I have taken car keys from people with force (fortunately I am a big fucker, so they will not try to knock me out to get them back), paid taxi fares, called good friends out on social media and have tried to leave from a friends place, before somebody else leaves who I knew would want to drive, just to not have to argue about it.

Unfortunately, I made a promise at the podium at a funeral of one of my very best friends, who was killed by a drunk driver, over a decade ago, to never let anyone drive drunk. I regret having to do all that crap, but I have never regret that promise.

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't drive fucked up, I have done so before my friend was killed and I was very lucky, even though I thought I had everything under control at all time.

The grading for one assignment was as follows

There are 4 categories, for each one you can get 8 points

For one of the categories you can get 11 instead of 8 if you are waaaay ahead with your writing skills and all that

Those 3 points are bonus

Haha no they are not you need all 35 for a 10/10

My boss was a hard stickler for the rules and didn‚Äôt like that 1) I wore one ring on each hand 2) my sideburns were slightly too long 3) my shoes weren‚Äôt dark enough. 

Each time he brought up a concern I addressed it (ditched a ring, shaved those sexy burns, and wore black shoes) but that had apparently been enough to raise concerns about a ‚Äúpattern of disobedience.‚Äù Pretty ridiculous.

Instead I ended working for a test prep company that let me set my own hours and paid me ludicrous money (for an undergrad). Glad it happened."

r/askreddit,"Years ago, I was working as a server for a chain restaurant, and I had only been working there for two weeks. The hostess and another server dealt with a table that dined and dashed; the hostess tried to stop them, but (rightfully) wasn‚Äôt willing to risk her safety over a $65 check. 


I had absolutely nothing to do with the incident. But for some reason, I was terminated 30 minutes after it happened. The manager bluntly explained it as, ‚Äúlast one hired, first one fired.‚Äù I cried into the FOH manager‚Äôs shoulder because I could not understand what I had done wrong.


But I got my revenge: it turned out that we have been ‚Äúshopped‚Äù by a secret shopper that night. *After* I had been fired, but I had been told to finish my shift. 

The week before, the same manager who fired me had promised $500 cash to any server who scored a 100 on a secret shopper, in addition to the $100 bonus the chain paid. They had never, in 17 years, scored a 100, and the manager desperately wanted it. Now, if I‚Äôm correct about who the secret shopper table was, they had seen me crying into my manager‚Äôs shoulder, wipe my tears, and continue serving them like nothing was wrong. If it was them, I am 100% sure they gave me a 100 out of nothing but sympathy.

The manager who fired me called me repeatedly for damn near a month when he received the score. I only answered once, and politely told him he could mail me the $500 he owed me. To his credit, he did."

She acted all rude about it, and when I checked my schedule again, shed not only left them, but changed my shifts for the last week so my hours were much shittier than normal. Didn't bother to inform me either.

Never went back. Got a call two days later saying I would be written up if I didn't return to work. Ok, cool, I've already quit.

r/askreddit,"I was driving rental cars from the airport to the company car wash / gas station and back to the airport (and also sometimes further away, but that does not matter for the story), to fund my studies. One of my bosses was a major asshole. I was also driving with the rental cars like I stole them, but also has nothing to do with the story.

For example: My colleagues and me drove six cars to the airport and one big and one very small car were supposed to be driven to the car wash. The asshole made one person drive back the big car and five people get in the small car to drive back up. He made the largest fella (estimated 150kg / 320lbs) get in the middle on the back seat.

One day, I was on car wash duty, which meant getting in the cars coming out of the car wash and turning them around to be vacuumed. It was close to the usual end of business and there were no cars for 15 minutes, so I went to the front desk and asked the asshole if I should wait for more cars or clock out. He asked me: 'has anybody told you to clock out? no, then stay'. I went back and thought 'whatever, I'll stay'. Another couple of cars came after a while and I turned them around. No cars came for 20 minutes and it was later than our usual closing time. I went back to the front desk and asked how much longer I should be staying. The asshole asked me if I was an idiot for waiting when no cars were coming anymore. I told the asshole that he told me to wait until he said so and that only stupid remarks were coming from his corner anyway.

Next time I was scheduled, the big boss took me aside upon arrival and asked if I had forgotten who was boss and to apologise. I refused and was fired - fuck them. I finished my studies and have proper well paid job now."

The note for the delivery said something like ""Leave the delivery at the door"" but I noticed he didn't tip.  X_X So I knocked because there wasn't a door bell but nobody came.  I called my boss and told him that there wasn't a tip and he gave me the guys phone number.  So I called and the guy ended up telling me to just come in.  I know, dumb idea.  Turned the handle and wierdly enough it was unlocked.  So I go in, I put the pizza down on the table and noticed a security camera with a red light.  It wasn't like hidden or anything.  It was like a normal security camera you would see in like a grocery story or something.

Felt really creeped out just standing around but eventually he came but he was completely naked.  I know a few other guys that did pizza delivery that told me that its happened to them before with girls but never a guy.  He gave me some crappy tip and stood way so close to me I could feel his breath.  We chatted for a little, he explained when he heard my voice on the phone he wanted to see the expression on my face if he walked out naked.  He gave me like 2 or 3 single dollar bills and asked if I wanted to stick around he could give me more or something.  He said it in reeeeeally creepy way.  I said its okay and he kept insisting and even said we couldsplit the pizza.  He said alot of other stuff too that I probably shouldnt say.  I told him I had to go back or I'd get in trouble and staired at my feet during the entire exchange and noped the fuck out of there right after, lol.  

I told my boss I'd rather work the register or something else and he told me he literally hired me for delivery BECAUSE I'm a girl.  He took a cut of our tips and wanted me to specifically do deliveries because I get higher tips.  After I told a co-worker about the creepy story and how I don't really want to do deliveries any more, he insisted he could show me how to prep the kitchen, clean around the restaurant and work the register.  When I got told I was getting fired for not wanting to do deliveries, my co-worker got in a argument with our boss and I heard he got fired also like a few months later.

Now I work at a diner and get leered at by a different set of creepy old dudes!  Somebody please save me from service industry!!!  X_X"

One of the clinical managers heard about it and fired him because ""the patient could have been strangled"". It was baffling because he used a method *that was taught to him by the hospital*. He used a ""safe"" technique to hold the patient down. Apparently he still shouldn't have done that even if its the hospital's freaking protocol.

r/askreddit,"I got my first proper full-time job when I was 20, as a fitness instructor in a large gym in a leisure centre.  There was a fitness instructor in his 50s who worked there, called Mark.  He was absolutely disgusting, and sexually harassed me constantly, and even sexually assaulted me on numerous occasions.  As examples, here are just a few of the things he did: groped my legs on numerous occasions, leaned over and kissed me on the lips when I wasn't expecting it, came behind me and stuck his hands under my shirt and unhooked my bra.  He was always saying disgusting things to me as well.  For instance instead of saying ""hello"" to me when I arrived at work, he'd stare at my chest and ask ""How are your breasts today?""  He'd even follow me in his car when I was walking the streets.  He would always corner me at work and get in my personal space and try to talk to me really inappropriately about my personal life.  It was just constant and he didn't care who knew it, he would even do it in front of people.  I became very unhappy at work and very stressed about going into work.  I was having sleepless nights worrying about it, suffering from excessive stomach acid and anxiety.  My boss wouldn't do anything to help.  He basically accused me of rocking the boat by not wanting to put up with this.

&amp;#x200B;

The final time, Mark groped my legs and said something dirty to me right in front of the boss and another fitness instructor.  I looked at my boss and asked, ""Aren't you going to do anything about this?""  My boss just gave me an angry warning look.  The next day he called me into his office and fired me, saying basically that my behaviour wasn't appropriate, I should be more happy and cheerful with everybody (in other words don't complain about what mark is doing) and I don't seem to be a good fit for this place.  He completely dismissed everything Mark had been doing to me and got rid of me.  I felt powerless to fight it as they were a huge company, so I just walked away.  Now I realise they wanted to fire me and make me look bad first, so that if I ever took action over Mark they could claim that I was just a disgruntled ex employee.

Imagine 50 computers running 50 1080p livestreams through a single connection. Add in the lag, which I counted was about 300ms between making a movement and having it appear on the screen. Really hard to draw with a stylus like that.

To top it all off, the requirement was to do 120 pictures in an hour, so 30 seconds for each picture max, including lag and waiting for the next one to appear. But breaks counted as time against us and the forced stretches too. Oh, and every image that was bad also counted against us.

r/askreddit,"       Retail manager of the 2nd most profitable store in the nation as well as national trainer. My district manager hired an assistant manager for my store without telling me she was even interviewing anyone. She was hired and just showed up one day to start work without me knowing anything. The person she hired was well known in the mall. She wasn‚Äôt allowed in half of it due to a restraining order from her previous store. I was livid.
      Complained to HR. District manager started writing me up for lies told to her by the asst manager. Who would be on the store phone literally for 7 out of every 8 hours. She was often no call, no show. Or would spend time wandering the part of the mall she was still allowed in.

      I was never allowed to write her up. I was supposedly causing a hostile work environment. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm being treated for stress related ailments. Considered filing for my own restraining order as she kept threatening to either kill me herself of have one of her two felon sons do it. But then she quit and got a job across the hall.
     My store‚Äôs holiday sales resulted in the district winning a week long trip to Disney World. When everyone else got their travel plans but I hadn‚Äôt, I called the travel agency. Who informed me that they had been told I was no longer with the company and my trip was canceled! Nice.

      A week later(!) the district manager shows up to tell me I‚Äôm fired because of the situation with the asst manager. This after 14 years, never having anything less than a exceeds expectations on a review , and having trained have the nation‚Äôs managers and district managers. Devastating

     Got my revenge though on pretty much everyone:
            -Someone I trained filed a class action suit about not being paid overtime. As queen of documentation, I gladly provided her lawyer with years of violations. Company eventually settled for multiple millions that went to the employees (I also got some). The company filed for bankruptcy soon after and now only has a small online presence.
            - the asst manager was hired to take my place (she‚Äôd been fired from her other store the day after me for the same shit she pulled with me). Sales tanked, customer complaints skyrocketed and then she was arrested for threatening to kill a customer.she eventually did jail time for a variety of offenses.
             - District manager lost her job over the whole thing. Was unemployed for over a year. Then, because she talked about herself a lot, I passed on some info to a friend of the family who worked for the IRS who she was already in trouble with. It‚Äôs been 16 years, and she‚Äôs still dealing with the fallout.
    However, I still have nightmares about the entire situation and it was suggested I had PTSD over it. Still terrified I‚Äôll get fired again.

They were shocked that I needed training and that I wasn't as good as they guy that I was to replace. He's been a jewler for 20 years and was leaving to start his own business. I asked them how they expected me to be on that level fresh out of school. They said that sense I had a degree they thought I was underselling how good I would be. Bunch of idiots.
r/askreddit,"Violating Public and Health Safety.

Was 18 years old at the time, working as a lifeguard and I was on opening morning shift. Came in at 5am and the pool chemicals were low but I still opened the pool  and usually the chemicals regulate themselves (ph was too low), anyway, it didn‚Äôt after an hour so I called/texted and left my boss a message and she didn‚Äôt return either one of my calls or responded back on what to do. (She did have a new baby at the time so idk if that played a factor).
Well she comes  in at 10. Sees the chemical balance and freaks out, gets it fixed on the right track, and all is good.. I get off at 1pm, get a chalk at 2pm to come into work with a lovely write up and that I‚Äôm fired. I tried to argue my case that I called her and left her a message and tried to contact her when it happened where she responded that she didn‚Äôt receive anything even though I showed her the phone calls. 
But in the write up, she listed in my 6 years of working all what I‚Äôd did wrong and made it sound like I did it in one day.

And to add icing on the cake, my twin sister was working with me and they ended up putting her information on the fired letter and not mine, which I told them I wouldn‚Äôt sign since it wasn‚Äôt my name they got mad at me. 

Just walked out, then I burst into tears and was very sad for a few days.

But that‚Äôs how I became an EMT and funny enough about 6ish months later we responded to a call to my old work place. My boss had broken her pelvis slipping on the deck. Imagine the look on her face when she saw me. It was very satisfying, had the honor of putting an IV in her, made sure to use a 14 gage needle. Petty now that I think about it but it was the only needle I ‚Äòcould‚Äô find at the time.

Guess i have to thank her for pushing me in the direction of becoming an EMT."

I never did the last year of my apprenticeship, still landed 2 jobs by telling them I did the apprenticeship, neither of them asked for any paperwork."
r/askreddit,"Technically I quit but I'll get to that. Worked my way up from clerk to department manager at a grocery store in around 3 years. The next 7 years I  was one if not the best managers they had. Always turning in a profit, always willing to do everything they needed, great with the staff excellent with the customers and so on.


 Then we get a new manager in who takes an instant dislike to me because he didn't agree with my management style. I prefer to have my staff do as I ask because they respect me. He preferred to have his staff do as their told out of fear of being fired. In the 9 years I'd worked for the chain I'd never been given any kind of write up. In the six months he'd been there I'd gotten 3. The breaker was when I'd come in sick on my day off to do some extra work he refused to let me leave. After that 14 hour day I'd had enough. Basically just dialed it in from that day forward. Did exactly what was required and nothing more.

One day I come in to work and he pulls me in the office with the district manager. Puts two pieces of paper in front of me and tells me to sign one. One says I voluntarily quit, the other says I understand my employment is being terminated. Signed the one saying I quit and walked out feeling just an overwhelming sense of relief. Called another manager who went to another chain and had another job within the month.


Last I heard he was fired because one of the female staff went to him after a male co-worker forced himself on her and instead of handling it he told her to get back to work."
r/askreddit,"I worked at a local chain restaurant which operated on a fixed schedule. This meant that you worked the exact same shifts from week to week and it never changed. It was actually really ideal for college students. Every semester the GM would ask for people to put in shift change requests so they could accommodate class schedules. By the end of my time there I was finished with undergrad and had applied to veterinary medical school, so I was pretty much waiting to see if i had been accepted. I worked opening shift Sun-Thur every single week and was always off Friday and Saturday. My mother (who can't drive) asked me sometime in February if I would be able to give her a ride to a conference in April on a Friday/Saturday. I would be back Saturday night in time to make my shift Sunday morning so I agreed.

April rolls around and manager posts a notice on the employee board that says all employees are required to work Friday/Saturday of local arts festival, and anyone who can't attend will be fired. I recognized that those days were the exact days I had already promised to drive my mom and brought it up with the manager, who basically just gave an ""ok"". I chose to go to the conference since I gave her ample warning. I had also been accepted to vet school so decided I would have had to quit anyway. She fired me over text message and I was cool with it. She was a pretty bad manager and the restaurant closed a few months later (not entirely her fault, the regional manager was crazy, but that's a different story). They were also investigated for tax fraud because of a few employee complaints (I was one of those employees), so I guess they got what was coming to them."

They would never follow OSHA safety regulations ( we would literally drill holes into concrete without wearing any respirators or safety glasses) and much more stupid shit. But it was Friday and the day before I just got back from an out of state job site we had been working on and I got food poisoning from eating mc Donald‚Äôs. The next day at work I had to wait for the work elevator in an apartment complex in Chicago to come down for five minutes as I had to stand holding a ladder trying not to let liquid shit come out of my ass. I rested my head on the ladder for 20 seconds as my stomach and asshole was killing me. The elevator came and I told my colleague that I felt sick to my stomach and I should just go home. He replies ‚Äúokay see you Monday‚Äù 
Monday comes around and I get a text from my boss to come to the office. He explains to me why  he brought me in. He told me that a worker at the apartment complex saw me ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù on a ladder and just walked away and I left work without telling anybody. I was honestly fed up and just sat there and took everything in and left. Two weeks later I find another job that paid 2x better, had benefits and retirement plans, and followed OSHA regulations so I didn‚Äôt have to worry about inhaling silica dust and dying of cancer. 

TLDR: got fired for supposedly sleeping on job and not telling anybody I was leaving early ( I had food poisoning and rested head on a ladder while waiting for elevator and told my colleague I didn‚Äôt feel good before I left)"
r/askreddit,I told the district manager on a call that if they opened the two new stores where they did they would canabalize two other stores.

She seemed shocked, and reminded me that I was one of only two employees scheduled from 3:30 to 4:00, and that she needed me there. I apologized, but repeated that I was not able to come to work. 

She hung up on me, and I was removed from the schedule permanently.

I was there to witness it and instead of just reporting this, we brought the driver to the parking area and manually pumped out everything from his engine.

I was given a 1 week break and then they called me for the lay off.

now mind you I'm also a newbie there.I was there for 2 months.

The system for laying off people is simple in this company, you get 3 warnings before the pink slip.

The report they had for me basically had them judging my 1 incident of not even me being negligent  ,as 3 warnings and the final work firing offense.in writing,the 3 warnings and final offense was;

*Not consulting with the shift manager.
*Not reporting the incident immediately.(yeah,its the same as the first one,they just had to fill the 3 warnings thing)
*Endangerment to workplace safety (they don't mean me just pumping the engine in the parking area but they meant the mistake of putting in petrol instead of diesel....which I didn't do)
*owner's safety infringement.



now,that last one is a bit odd but I was told by one of my friend who worked in the management there that that was basically bullshit because the only reason that was on there was because I had told the customer who was a nice person on top of them being a customs officer that the owner is in the building.sure I had to direct him to the manager instead but it wasn't like I told him where the owner was,just that he's here.



The next gas station I worked at was not this bad and wasn't as cult-ish so I'm glad I was fired,I wish I was fired sooner,they don't deserve my hard work.I kept that job for 4 months before having to leave for Uni."

He'd then elaborate that all the cranes and construction workers where a concentrated effort, to both restore the building, and to seal the dragon underneath it.

r/askreddit,"This is a good question. I care for my grandmother who has dementia and it's been 7 years.  First thing I noticed was her becoming testy.  She started to not be the sweet grandma anymore.  She also started calling me a liar because she couldn't remember things. I was getting puzzled as to why she couldn't remember things.  Then it started to dawn on me.  Got her diagnosed and started on medication.  

Now, seven years later,  she can't remember anything from a minute ago. Yet,  she can tell you anything from 50 years ago like it just happened.  Crazy how this disease works."
r/askreddit,"We were visiting my great aunt. At this point she lived in her own house (no kids, never married). My mother comments that she liked a vase she had in her living room. My great aunt said ""thanks, it was Mother's. I'll have to ask her where she got it.""

This was about 2004-2005ish. Her mother had been dead since 1955. It wasn't long before it became more obvious. 

Just as an aside, as a nurse who works with dementia patients, it breaks my heart when they ask me about their parents,  as if they were still alive (or their deceased spouse for that matter)."
r/askreddit,"My great-grandmother died of Alzheimer's. It is truly a troubling ride. At first, it was short term memory, simple things. However, the biggest red flag was - get this - she would see chickens all over the place. She would try to chase these imaginary chickens around the living room, or would kick her feet as if to get them to fuck off. She would also clean imaginary spider-webs. 

I was once told that often Alzheimer's patients will relive old memories - my great-grandmother grew up in 1920's El Salvador - likely lived on a farm with chickens."
r/askreddit,"Not my parents, but my grandma. She was 92 by the time dementia began to creep in, but it consumed her completely within 3 years. 

First, it was little things -but very noticeable-, such as words. A few months later, it was people; she would confuse people from her past and the present. Then, she started hallucinating and making up stories about people that didn't exist doing things with her she couldn't have possibly done (like go to places that no longer existed in my hometown or visiting friends that were dead). Next, she completely forgot about my grandpa (who'd been dead for ten years at this point, and to whom she'd been married for over 50), and after that she also forgot about her firstborn son, who had died 8 years before.

A year after that, she no longer recognized any of our relatives, except for my father, who took care of her until her last moments. However, she never forgot about me. I was her first granddaughter and named after her mother (whom she'd also forgotten about), and my dad told me all the time that she would spend days without saying a word, then suddenly ask about me, or light up when he said my name.

It was very painful to watch her turn into a shadow of the amazing woman she'd always been."
r/askreddit,"I was away at school when Mama first, first started. but it was things like not obeying driving rules, not listening when we told her something, not following the plot of simple movies and... over reacting to them? like I was watching the old animated Cinderella movie, and she couldn't understand why the step mom was being so mean. or why the animals were talking. she also got super religious (she's always been, but it got intense for a year or so) and lost any sense of... tact? like trying to convert a widow to her religion at the memorial service.  that happened. it was yikes. 

it's been two years since the official diagnosis. she's... bad. she no longer understands concepts like time (1 am and 1 pm are the same to her, she can't differentiate between today/tomorrow) or safety or not waking people up constantly... she no longer recognizes anyone aside from her mother (gran is 93 and mentally fine), my father, me, and my brother. doesn't know our cat. doesn't know her brothers, doesn't know friends she'd been close to for 40+ years...

my life changed a lot. I have no energy because any time spent out of work is keeping an eye on her.  she's like a toddler, she isn't capable of logic or understanding orders, much less following them... it's hell. i hate the person I am around her. I want to move away. my mother is dead, her body just hasn't realized it yet.

Edit: thank you for all the kind words (and the silver!)
my dad and I have been looking into a care facility, but ultimately the decision is up to dad and he wants her to stay at home as long as possible... which we both agree won't be much longer, but for now he's a bit in denial."
r/askreddit,"My dad's aunt died of Alzheimers. I witnessed a bit of it from visiting, and she was worse every time, so I feel like I saw the spiral. 

She was married to her husband since they were 17 and she was 84 when she died. They had known each other literally their entire lives...they were actually switched at birth. Throughout this whole ordeal her husband was 100% of sound mind.  

At first, she would just stop talking in the middle of a sentence, or walk into a room and forget why she went in there, but then it progressed into walking into a room and staring blankly for several minutes. Then she started talking to herself in complete gibberish but only when she thought nobody could hear.  

Then one day when I was there she called the police because there were strangers in her house...aka, me.  After the police left she was sweet as pie again. A few hours later she called the police again on me because she left the room and came back and didn't recognize me.      


The next time I went, the police were already there and she had called because she didn't recognize her husband. She kept saying that William was supposed to come home any minute (nobody knew who William was) and he would throw a fit. She also always carried a knife and would frantically check for it several times an hour until she fell asleep.    


By this point the police knew she was going downhill but because you never want to tell a person with dementia they're wrong, they came anyway. It was a small town...they weren't ever very busy.        

Eventually conversations became impossible and the only way she could even make words was if you played music she was familiar with. She knew every Elvis song by heart until damn near the end.    


She started chewing her food and forgetting to swallow. Most of the time she would just spit it out, but sometimes she choked. Over time she decided she just didn't want to eat anymore. We think this is when she subconsciously realized she didn't want to live like this anymore....at least that's how we rationalized it.   


Finally, she stopped drinking water. Nobody could give it to her, unless they were willing to get stabbed. Her husband did a few times. Her advance directive, made well before her downward spiral, specifically stated no life-giving measures would be taken or prolonged and her nurses said this included water...so her husband had to just let her go. She died a week later at home, with Elvis on the Victrola and her knife on her chest.  Her husband said she passed away with a smile on her face and he swears deep down inside she knew she was fucked and so she just ended it on her own accord. I don't know...but it was crazy to see how things changed so drastically every time I visited over the course of a couple years."
r/askreddit,"My grandpa always kept a clean house. Then one visit it was dirty. Looking back, that's when it all started to make sense."
r/askreddit,"I have become a caretaker for both my parents who have dementia of different types and levels. Dementia is actually a broad term, not a specific condition, unlike Alzheimer's. My mother forgets things all the time. The good news is she has adapted to me caring for her and recognizes that she forgets. She laughs about it. My Dad struggles a lot because he really wants to be self-sufficient and prove it, but keeps struggling. I have to let him do projects and take some responsibility for things because it keeps him going, even though often he makes more problems that way. He has a lot of trouble with words and frequently gets irritated with Mom and I when he can't communicate. He also has hearing problems.

&amp;#x200B;

I was angry about it for maybe a year. I kind of accepted the role, but I also resented it and kind of let people know that I wasn't living the life I wanted to live. (obviously I could walk away, but my parents have been very good and supportive to me most my life). Then I hit a point where I accepted it. I stopped pushing them to consider going into a home and figured this is just what I am doing right now. In some sense I feel pretty good that they are having a better quality of life than they could without me. Since I came to that realization I have mostly felt good and also done more things for myself."
r/askreddit,"My grandmother first kept forgetting the grandkids names, or simply called them by a different grandkids name.

The day she passed she was so lucid and calm.  She looked at my mother in her last moments and said ""I know the last few months have been hard on you.   I love you with everything I have and was.""  Her big blue eyes went wide one last time and she leaned forward and embraced my mother and died in her arms.   It was one of the most beautiful moments I have ever experienced.    Thank you for asking so I could remember her today."
r/askreddit,"My dad started getting lost driving to/from short errands he'd done hundreds of times.  Then he'd start saying things that just seemed 'off'.  Then he started forgetting to take his insulin, so his 'wife' would end up calling him an ambulance once a month or so.  

None of us kids lived in the same town, so it took longer than it should have to get him help.  By that time, he was trying to eat the wooden decorative fruit.

His 'wife' (together 20 years but never married) has it even worse, and they are both in care homes now.  Sadly, they aren't married, and he's in one  home that the state will cover, while she's in another one that's covered by her long term care insurance.  Separating them nearly killed us.

My sister moved to his town to be closer to him.  Some days he holds decent short conversations, but often gets confused and changes the subject to whatever is directly in his line of sight (water bottle, fork, whatever.)   We had to sell everything he owned (house, motor home, etc.) to pay for his care, then once those funds ran out, the state took over.  He doesn't know this, and plans to live in his motor home when he 'gets better.'"
r/askreddit,"There's a phenomenon called confabulation where a person's mind is starting to go, so their brain connects the dots as best it can and the person thinks their understanding is correct--even when they're wrong.

The dilemma for others is confabulation looks like lying.

For example, the parent and their longtime friend dispute a brunch bill. Each insists the other is trying to weasel out of paying for a mimosa. It's only a few dollars but they get worked up about it.

If there's a lesson to be learned here, it's that people who have a family history of Alzheimer's have an extra reason to develop a reputation for honesty. If everyone knows that you're not trying to put one over on people, then if your wits start to slip then confabulation stands out because it's out of character. It's easier to get the assistance you need when everyone knows you're doing your best.

Unfortunately my mother never cultivated that good reputation."
r/askreddit,"I didn't see my parents go through this. At least not yet. Hopefully that doesn't happen. 

But I did see my grandma go through this. It was tough on the entire family, especially my grandpa. But he definitely taught me something about love in regards to this. They've both passed and I love them both immensely. 

I am reluctant to even say this because it makes it more real, but... I do see some things that my dad does that reminds me of what my grandma went through. Once we learned that my Grandma had Alzheimer's and learned more about the symptoms, it made sense. There were things over a decade (or maybe more) that could have been signs. 

For my dad, it's more memory things. And a little anger about things at times. I've talked to my sister about it (we're both in our 30s). At this point it's one of those things that it could just be aging, or it could be early signs. I think we are both overly sensitive because of my grandma. But that's not a bad thing."

r/askreddit,"My mother has started asking me the same shit over and over lately. Not in a ""not paying attention"" kind of way. In a ""Mom, you called me this afternoon"" sort of way. No one in my family has ever had dementia. But I'm pretty certain this is the beginning. 

A couple weeks ago I called her and asked her tons of questions about glasses. I am in my 40s and am just now needing them for the first time ever. The next day she texted me and asked if I ever went to the eye doctor."
r/askreddit,"My mother had Alzheimer‚Äôs. There were things that were ‚Äúoff‚Äù, but not drastic, for quite a while that we were only able to recognize as signs in hindsight. She started repeating herself, sometimes during the same conversation. But she was also very intelligent, so she hid a lot of her memory issues for a long time I think. 

Her judgment was off. She would do or say things, and while not outrageous, were not her. She had always handled the money and bills in the family, and in the past had been very good at avoiding debt. My husband works in finance, and when going over their statements, he found some alarming stuff. Evidently she was giving money to anyone who was selling anything. Tons of magazine subscriptions- some multiples of the same magazine every month. Every bleeding heart charity that sent junk mail she was giving money to. 

She got into a few minor fender benders after having never had an accident ever. 

The house started to look like the beginnings of a hoard. 

One of the weirdest signs I actually read a study about later. Some people with early Alzheimer‚Äôs seem to lose a lot of their sense of smell. And my mother had an excellent sense of smell, as kids we all picked up her habit of smelling every before eating it. Well, combined with the bad judgement, she made egg salad with decorated eggs left over from easter that were clearly not good. She should have been able to detect that. It made her very sick. 

Looking back, there were many little signs like this. But overall, her overall personality was changing. Sadly, it became completely undeniable after the sudden death of my brother. I think the stress escalated the decline greatly.

It‚Äôs interesting though, as another commentator said, memory is weird. She couldn‚Äôt remember your name or what she had for lunch - but could vividly recall memories of her childhood. She also never forgot certain poetry or songs. And even up to the end when she was largely non-verbal, she would somehow pipe up and correct someone‚Äôs grammar."
r/askreddit,"My grandmother started putting random things in her purse. It started with lots of napkins at restaurants, but soon it could be anything from anywhere."
r/askreddit,"It's hard to say, and I think about this a lot. My mom has the alzheimer's, and after she retired (which she really wanted to do), she got... sad? Which was weird, it was very unlike her. I remember her telling me that she didn't know what to do with herself anymore. I tried to be supportive, but I lived out of state, and wasn't around much.

There was also other stuff, like she was really into cooking/baking particular recipes, ones I grew up with, which she just sort of forgot about. I'd come home to visit and she didn't really give a shit about me being there, which was weird too.

My life has changed. Changed in what capacity, well, that's a tough question. I do think I'm stronger because of it. 

About three years ago, shit hit the fan and I had to intervene with my parents. Mom was still living with my dad, who was doing jack shit in taking care of her, and by that time, she really did need extra help. At that point, it wasn't a sad situation, just one that needed help. Sort of like, flight or fight. But in this case, flight was sadness and fight was becoming a caretaker to make sure my mom was comfortable and hygienically clean. 

A few months later, my dad passed and my sibling and I became full time caretakers and poa's for my mom. It's been challenging in MANY ways, sometimes the least of which was my mom and how she was doing.

Through the last three years, my mom has regressed and regressed. I've considered myself a mom for my mom for a long time. At this point, she's like a slower two year old in a woman's body. 

But there have been some really happy times too. My mom was a pretty good baker and cook, and I would still make food with her, except this time, I was the teacher. Or the times when I thought my mom couldn't do something any more, and she would surprise me and be able to still do it. I recently learned that she can still read if you point at words and ask her what they say. Or times when she would say something silly and make us laugh. 

You have to deal with this shit with a lot of humor, and try to look at the bright side. Like, how my mom had an injury and had to go to a hospital, and then into a rehab nursing home. The nursing home people got a report from her hospital saying she couldn't feed herself or talk. I had to advocate saying she could do all of this! Just maybe not at the pace you want her to.

Well, the second day she was there, I sat in on her physical therapy, and she fucking. nailed. everything. She surprised them all. And then she ate her own lunch, and an aid was like, she can feed herself? And I was like, YES! she can!

Or the time when a family member and I took her to a pool. She was more active at this point, but still not doing well. She had been a swimmer many years before, and once we finally coerced her into the pool, she swam like a fish with little of our help.

Even now, she really is incapable of doing much for herself, but there are still times like when I ask if I can watch tv with her, and she'll nod her head yes. Or if I'm putting on her socks and shoes, she'll lift her feet up so I can put them on her. There's still communication, although infrequent, but it makes my heart happy.

Anyhow, I'm not sad about it anymore, and haven't been for a few years now. I lost my mom a long time ago. She's still alive, but alzheimer's took her away from me and my family years ago. Now it's just trying to make her as comfortable as possible, and I feel I've become a stronger and wiser person because of it.

tldr: Alzheimer's sucks. I'm not sad about it anymore. Taking care of my mom has made me a stronger person. 

Also, I'm sort of an open book, as long as I don't have to give out personal details. If anyone wants to ask something, go for it.

edit: words."
r/askreddit,"Man, just even reading this question gets me emotional. This is going to be a very long post and I‚Äôm on mobile, so I apologize for formatting.  My mom has severe early onset dementia but my family didn‚Äôt know about her condition/the severity of it until about three years ago. 

Some background information: my mother had me in her early 40‚Äôs and I‚Äôm the last kid she had. My parents are pretty old and old fashioned. My dad was the breadwinner and my mom stayed at home to take care of me and my sister and raise us. 

The beginning:

From a very early age, I remember my dad would get onto my mom for small things she‚Äôd forget to do. This would include things like getting his work outfit ready for the next day or paying a bill. Just small things that didn‚Äôt really raise any alarms because we‚Äôre human and we forget things sometimes. Besides that, as I was growing up, my mother seemed perfectly fine. She took care of me well, always cooked dinner, played with me, and took care of the household. However, it was towards the middle of ninth grade that things began to turn for the worst. 

The decline:

I was about 15 at the time and my mom still drove me to school everyday. I remember one particular morning, since the drive from my house to my school was particularly long, I decided to nap because I was tired.  I was abruptly woken up because we had gotten into a car accident. She stopped at a stop sign and had tried crossing the fairly busy road that we normally crossed everyday as a shortcut to get to school. I‚Äôm not exactly sure what happened because I was sleeping, but I do remember feeling panic when I woke up. From what I recalled, she pulled out in front of another person who t-boned our car. She was 100% at fault. Luckily, no one was harmed but our car was inoperable. We were almost at school, so I was able to catch a ride with the firefighters who dropped me off. I remember trying to call my mom throughout the day because I had no idea how I was getting home. After hours of calling her throughout the school day when I got the chance, she finally picked up the phone and I was able to get a ride home from our insurance agent‚Äôs daughter who also went to my school. Upon arriving home, I learned that my mother had been on the phone all day trying to take care of the car situation. She wasn‚Äôt making any sense when I would ask her what was going on, so I had to call our insurance agency to figure out what was going on. As soon as I called and explained the situation, the insurance agent asked me if something was wrong with my mom. I will never forget that phone conversation for as long as I‚Äôm alive. The agent explained that she had been explaining the process to my mom all day and that she was concerned about my mom because she seemed very confused and couldn‚Äôt understand what was going on. I had to hold back tears at this point because it confirmed my suspicion that something was wrong with her. 

Before the car accident, she would often forget certain words in casual conversations and would have to be reminded what the word she was looking for was. I also remember when I was due to get my wisdom teeth removed, my father had left a voicemail on my mothers phone explaining how everything was already paid for and that all she needed to do was take me to the dentist. She replayed that voicemail about 30 times, trying to write notes for herself. It got to the point where I sat out with her to make sure I knew what my dad was telling my mom what to do just in case she forgot. Also, around this time she was increasingly having trouble with handling and paying our bills. She was beginning to forget more than just the little things at this point. 

The accelerating deterioration:

After years of continuous forgetful behavior and language problems, my father finally took my mother to the doctor. He confirmed that my mother had severe dementia and that it was rare for her to have it at such a young age. This is when she was around 55. I had never seen my dad cry until that night when he told my sister I. We were all in tears that night. After all these years of deteriorating, I can‚Äôt truly remember what she was like when I was younger. She‚Äôs still alive, but I seriously doubt she has that many years left. Within a matter of three years, she cannot form coherent sentences nor can she say individual words. At this point, you have to guess what she‚Äôs trying to say but you never truly know. She cannot drive, cook, or take care of herself. My dad has to shower her, clothe her, cook for her, and help her eat. She cannot go to the bathroom by herself and it‚Äôs gotten to the point where she has to wear adult diapers. My dad bought pee pads for the bed and the chair she sits on because she has a lot of accidents even with my dad there to help her. 

How my life changed:

It‚Äôs sad to say, but I truly feel like I don‚Äôt have a mother anymore. My mom is an empty shell of the person she once was. She‚Äôs only 62 and cannot do anything for herself at this point. She refuses to swallow her blood pressure pills and I‚Äôm scared she‚Äôll get to the point where she can no longer swallow. She‚Äôs already so bad and she‚Äôs still deteriorating. I can‚Äôt have a conversation with her due to her not being able to form sentences and I‚Äôm fearful of the day when she forgets who I am. My mom was always so happy and kind and loving.  Just thinking about all of this right now has brought me to tears. I never truly appreciated her when I was younger. But now that I‚Äôm an adult and I want to call her, tell her about my life, ask her how she‚Äôs doing, I can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the part that kills me the most. I really can‚Äôt even remember what my mom was like before this awful disease took over because I was so young, which is the saddest part of it all. All I can remember from my teenage years to now is her suffering from this disease. When I see my friends bonding with their mothers it makes me sad because I know I‚Äôll never have that. Whenever I come home from college my dad tells me how much she‚Äôs been crying. When I leave to go back to college she cries then as well. I‚Äôve never once seen my mom cry and now it‚Äôs almost all that I see her do. It breaks my heart because I KNOW she knows something is wrong with her, but she doesn‚Äôt know what. I‚Äôve had many nights where I‚Äôve cried myself to sleep thinking that she probably won‚Äôt live long enough to see me get married or have kids. 

Never in a million years did I think I would end up taking care of my mom as quickly as I had to. It forced me to grow up fast and impacted my sister just as hard, if not harder. My sister remembers my mother better than I can since she‚Äôs older than me and was able to appreciate her before I could. 


Dementia/Alzheimer‚Äôs is a nasty nasty disease with no cure. It‚Äôs progressive which means my mom is only going to get worse. Appreciate your parents while you still can. I sure wish I would‚Äôve when I was younger. I have a lot of regrets, but not appreciating my mother and talking to her back when she could talk is my greatest regret. This has been such a touchy subject for me and brings up a lot of emotions. I apologize for this huge wall of text. For those of you who never have had to experience a loved one going through this, especially a parent, consider yourself lucky. I would never wish this awful disease on even my worst enemy. I feel like my family is broken because of it and I can tell it‚Äôs affecting my dad a lot more than he let‚Äôs on. Hug your parents. Give them a call. 

I love you mom. I hope you‚Äôll see me graduate."

r/askreddit,"My father died of dementia. It was a very slow, painful process. He was not in pain (thankfully) but it was sad to watch him slowly forget everything. Who we were, how to take care of himself, etc. He was in the Marines, the Navy, and after his military career an ER surgeon. Just an overall fantastic, badass, tough dude. It was really hard to see him deteriorate.

At first, we noticed that he would start saying weird things. He was really paranoid that the neighbors were watching us through the window, or that people were in the house with weapons. He frequently took my brother and I in the car in the middle of the night because he thought people were coming after us. Him and my mom started fighting a lot too. It was hard for me because I was a young child and didn‚Äôt understand what was going on. My parents had a very strong marriage as well (still did, right to the end) but the frequent fighting scared me.

Then, one day, he took the car in the middle of the night and drove the wrong way down the freeway. Granted when I say ‚Äúcar‚Äù it was really a Ford E-350 converted camper van, so it was HUGE and had he gotten hit, the other guy would be the one getting hurt. He was very lucky that night, no accidents or injuries. The highway patrol detained him until we could pick him up 3 hours away. My dad said that all the cars were coming at him, and he didn‚Äôt know why. That he was scared. To reiterate, hearing this from a former Marine and Navy man, it was heartbreaking. It didn‚Äôt register for me what was going on then.

Some of my favourite memories of my dad during this time was him and my mom. He didn‚Äôt remember my brother and I, we were around 11 and 13 respectively. But he always remembered my mom. He never forgot who she was. He didn‚Äôt even forget her birthday, or their anniversary. It was both beautiful and painful. 

Towards the end, we put him in hospice to die peacefully. He had said in his will that he would not want to be kept alive in a state like that. I don‚Äôt blame him. My father was an amazing man and lived a full, happy life. In the end, I am sad to have lost him but grateful for that fact. I know you only asked for signs from the very beginning, but I‚Äôve never gotten to share my story before and thought this would be a good outlet. To anybody who is experiencing what I have gone through, I send my thoughts your way.

Sorry for formatting I‚Äôm on mobile."
r/askreddit,"Balance; that weird half-backward stumble once in a while.  Once you see it you start to notice that all their reaction times are just a little too slow for normal balance.

The next thing (which was likely there all along but you didn't catch on) is the confusion and memory recall issues that are covered up with bluster or by pretending they were joking.  This progresses into obstinate denial that there's a problem (in my experience, to the point that they are essentially claiming to be mentally better than they were when they were much younger) and eventually aggression.

At this point, they still have the capability to know there's a problem *and they know*... but they're refusing to accept it or make any behavioral concessions to compensate for it.  That's why my father-in-law is currently a neighborhood risk for killing someone with his car.  My mother-in-law is doing the same thing as if pretending there's no problem will make it go away.

It's putting a massive amount of stress on the family, and when his mind is far enough gone it's probably going to wipe out my in-law's money and leave his frail wife with a very uncomfortable last few years - my wife and I aren't wealthy enough to help much, and dementia care is *expensive*.

I don't know from experience what the next stages are like (yet), but my understanding from others who have been through this as a spectator is that there is some peace towards the end stages after it's been pretty nasty for a while."
r/askreddit,"The first thing that really made it clear was when my grandpa got lost while driving from one town to another. Then he dropped my grandma off at the front of a store, forgot why he was there, and went home without her. Looking back, there were many more signs. Hoarding, grumpiness, not following through on simple tasks/chores. I think, looking back now, one of the biggest changes was just how quiet he got. He was such a loud and talkative person, but as he started to lose track of things he got quieter and quieter, not wanting to share his opinion because he wasn't sure what was going on. 

""Best"" part about my grandpa's Alzheimer's? When my grandma first became concerned and started asking doctors about it, they all told her that she nagged him too much, so that's why he didn't listen anymore, because he was tuning her out from all the nagging. smh (For reference, this was in the 2000's)"
r/askreddit,"I‚Äôm 23, my best friend is 50 (yeah yeah weird whatever, we have a lot in common) and we spend a LOT of time together. Sometimes I see her brain slip. We often go shopping and she will see something she thinks I may like and gets it for me. Sometimes not long after this happens she will see it in my house and remark how cute it is and ask where I got it when she‚Äôs the one who got it for me. If I ask her if she remembers she‚Äôll say she does not. I attended a doctor‚Äôs appointment with her and when she stepped out to use the bathroom I mentioned this to the doctor. He thanked me and said he would make a mental note. She‚Äôs my best friend. I‚Äôm scared."
r/askreddit,"My mom has dementia. My dad noticed it months before I did, commenting that he was worried that she was becoming more forgetful.

I thought he was worrying over nothing, until one day I found several ready meals - out of date by a month - hidden away in the back of her wardrobe. When I asked her about them she justified her actions by saying that she put them there because she didn't want my dad to get angry about her wasting food.

To hear her - who had always been the smartest person I'd known, and who otherwise seemed fine - utter such a bizarre comment, and to know that it made complete sense to her, was absolutely heartbreaking.

In hindsight the signs had been there for months. Small behavioural changes, like the way she stopped reading but kept buying books, such that her ""to read"" pile ballooned from around ten books to well over forty in a few months. Or the way her appetite changed and her palate diminished, and she started eating the same couple of chicken dishes night after night.

She's now in a care home where she is looked after and happy, fortunately, but no longer knows who I am. I can't quite believe how quickly it has all happened."
r/askreddit,[deleted]
r/askreddit,"(Just for reference, before I fully launch into the story, I will say that my dad was 52 when I was born. He‚Äôs a much older parent). 

In the early days, the signs were smaller. He‚Äôd forget to pick me up from school when he‚Äôd promised to. His bathroom mirror was covered in post it notes with reminders. He was relatively tech savvy for a senior citizen, but he started forgetting how to work his computer and his phone over time. He used to preemptively offer me opportunities to reload my transit card, but I started having to ask him to do it.(I grew up in Chicago, where most high school students use public transit to get to school. That card had to have money on it at all times, or I was screwed.) 

Over the next year or so, it got worse. He‚Äôd forget my choir concerts. My birthday.  To check his blood sugar. That he even HAD type 2 diabetes in the first place and that he needed to monitor it. He started dating a new woman, and she‚Äôs very controlling of him, something she can be because he has memory issues. 

Now, he forgets my name. He forgets that he has a daughter quite often. He has the memory span of a goldfish, and it‚Äôs terrifying. He shouldn‚Äôt be driving, and has admitted it, but his new girlfriend made sure he has a car so that she doesn‚Äôt always have to drive him places.(Yes, I looked into it. In my home state, you can‚Äôt just place an anonymous concern call to the DMV or any legal bodies). 

The most recent time I saw him for an extended period of time was early last year. I had a small amount of college money that I wanted to use, and it needed to be signed over to me and notarized. My mother and I took him to he credit union to do it. He constantly asked where we were going, what we were doing, and why. It was awful. He forgot how much he disliked my mother, but he also forgot how much he liked me.  I‚Äôm no longer his daughter. 

Symptoms started about five years ago. I‚Äôm in college now, and I go to school 1,200 miles away from home. I can‚Äôt tell my dad about my scholarship, or how I‚Äôm going to be a nurse, or that I‚Äôm going to Thailand this summer. He doesn‚Äôt remember how to work his phone, his girlfriend won‚Äôt pick up, and even if I did tell him these things, he wouldn‚Äôt remember. 

It was really hard at first. High school was incredibly difficult for me, and being seventeen and having my father forget to come to my concerts, the only big thing that brought me joy, tended to turn the knife a bit. My relationship with my mother was terrible, as she was dating a crap guy for most of my childhood. Our relationship is better now, thanks to the new guy, but there were years where I didn‚Äôt have a real parent. My dad developed even stronger paranoia than before, and when I told him I was spending summer 2016 in Germany, he freaked out and was convinced I would be sold into ‚Äúwhite slavery‚Äù. 

There was a point in early 2017 where I went over to his girlfriend‚Äôs house, where he now lives, to ask for money to help with a dental appointment. His girlfriend berated me for asking him, when he used to be the parent who made sure my health came first. My dad was the one I could call when I was sick, and he would take me to the doctor without hesitation. That wasn‚Äôt him anymore. He couldn‚Äôt focus on the conversation, his girlfriend berated me, and I just went back to my best friend‚Äôs house and broke down. This was the day that I knew that my dad was gone. 

Acknowledging the absurdity of my life has helped a lot. I‚Äôm 21 years old, and my dad cannot remember my name very often. However, I‚Äôm still bitter. So many of my peers have relationships with their fathers, and have help from them, and mine just doesn‚Äôt do that anymore. It feels like he was taken from me, and it‚Äôs terrible. I make a lot of dark jokes to cope with it, and I‚Äôm trying my best to just keep moving forward. I look fondly back at the good times we had, the inside jokes and the weird shared interests. I‚Äôll hold on to the American Girl doll he got me for my eleventh birthday forever, and if I ever have a daughter, I‚Äôll pass her on. 

In less than two years‚Äô time, I‚Äôm going to be a nurse, with a bachelor‚Äôs degree! I could live anywhere in the country, and if I‚Äôm smart with my money, I can live a good life. I just wish I could show my dad my successes, especially given the rough time I was going through when his memory issues started."
r/askreddit,"My grandpa was a math teacher, so super smart guy, and loved to play solitaire manually with a deck of cards. It was almost comical when you would walk by and realize the game was completely wrong/mis-matched, even though it was set up correctly with the right number of cards in each spot. It‚Äôs such a shitty situation you just kind of have to find the good things in the bad. He would always be asking my aunt when she was finally going to retire and she would change her answer every time he asked just to keep the conversation going. Ex. Retiring in 3 years, another 10 years, I retired last year."
r/askreddit,"Bewilderment in mundane conversations, inability to handle anything stressful, and of course forgetfulness. Try making a somewhat complex talking point, and see if they follow you - I noticed my father couldn‚Äôt keep up with conversations like this anymore, even though he was highly intelligent and used to talk circles around me.  I used to take it personally, his attitude made it seem like he was brushing off whatever I was saying, as if he didn‚Äôt want to dignify what I was saying with a response... it took a long time to have the ‚Äúah-ha‚Äù moment, to realize he just wasn‚Äôt following through thought processes anymore."
r/askreddit,"We noticed our grandmother acting really upbeat and happy, joking around with everyone and not giving a Damn when she used to be the more stern, maternal, central figure of the family. So we checked to see if she had been taking any medication we weren't aware of, and that was a dead end. After that we took her to get some checkups at the hospital and it turned out she had a brain tumour which was affecting her behaviour so, not a very welcome surprise."
r/askreddit,"I used to live with my ex while his father slowly slipped into the droves of dementia. I‚Äôm not him so I can‚Äôt speak from experience, but I know from living in that house and assisting with his care during our relationship that it put huge strain on several things (the family dynamic, his relationship with his father, his parents relationship). My ex was really good at being super cold and not that emotional, so it had a negative impact but he didn‚Äôt talk about it or show it much. But it killed me to see the negative effect it had on his mothers mental health. Even though we aren‚Äôt dating anymore I still check up on her to make sure she‚Äôs okay once in a blue moon because it‚Äôs destroying her."
r/askreddit,"The first definite sign might seem unusual to some people but given the circumstances it was very obvious. 

My grandma is obsessed with turtles and tortoises. She loves them. She used to pick up turtles off busy roads and care for them, even rehabilitate ones with damaged shells that had been hit. So one day she came over to our house to take my little sister to her ballet class when she showed the dead baby turtle she had found on her driveway. She had it in a little plastic bag. 

She kept calling it a box turtle but it was 150% a snapping turtle. You could tell because snapping turtles have leathery looking shells and very long pointy tails. When we pointed out that this was a snapping turtle baby and not a box turtle baby she had a fit and started yelling at us. It confirmed our suspicions and that‚Äôs when we knew she was developing dementia for sure. 

That was 2-3 years ago. Since then she regularly forgets her sons (or at least gets them mixed up), short term memory is pretty spare, has no sense of direction, repeats conversations, has no idea how much time has passed, etc. She‚Äôs been living at our house since we moved more than a year ago and she thinks she‚Äôs only been there for a couple weeks."
r/askreddit,"Dad got very confused on a long flight a couple of years before he was actually diagnosed.  He thought that the plane was skimming along at roof level when in reality it was at full cruising altitude. He got very worried and upset, and scared mum. 

He'd become forgetful and vague, exhibited poor judgement sometimes. He was OK and remained undiagnosed until one Boxing day.  He got angry and confused, asked what the dial on the wall was there for (it was a clock)  and threatened me with violence when I got a bit too close to him whilst picking up some food he'd dropped.  

He was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, and the Doc said that the increase in temperature was probably enough to push him over the edge.  

He recovered somewhat after the UTI was treated, but his decline into dementia started in earnest that day.  

As others have mentioned, he got testy and temperamental, I believe this may have been partly caused by his loss of independence,  he had to get rid of the car and so on.   

I used to take he and mum shopping, but I would take him out to The Point, we'd sit and have an ice cream or a coffee while mum shopped. He got like an unsupervised child in the supermarket, wandering off and picking up random items and putting them in both mum's and other people's shopping carts.  

He got a bit mean spirited towards mum,  which she found very hard, she couldn't separate his words from the disease. She took quite personally things that I was able to let slide.  

One day when he was in respite care for a couple of days, mum and I were talking over dinner and she actually used the phrase '.. back when Dad was alive..' 

We lost him about two years before he passed."
r/askreddit,"This one hits home,my father lost his battle with Alzheimer's after 7 years and finally succumbed today.
The very first thing that I ever noticed was he came to visit and I'd given him registrations for some quads that I had at his cabin. The next morning he came out of the guest room and said somehow I have a bunch of your information in my bag. he had no recollection of the conversations from the evening before.I pulled my mom aside and asked if she'd noticed anything about Dad and she said but he's just acting what compliant lately and a bit forgetful. I told her what happened and the next weekend I went to their place, my mother never noticed anything was seriously wrong. I told my mom there's something going on and it finally clicked for her. she took him to the doctors and they did tests and said that he had early-onset Alzheimer's he was 74 years old. in the beginning it was just him not remembering conversations or he'd tell the same story one or two three times a day like he hadn't told me these things before. The last 3 years have been hell since my mother passed away, she was his caregiver. Fortunately he was well enough off that near the end he had round-the-clock caregivers. I was with him for the last two weeks. The first week he was still able to chat a little and feed himself but needed help doing everything, then last week he fell out of bed trying to get up to go to the bathroom, and never got out of bed again and could not remember who I was, where he was, and could only talk in 3 word sentences. But when we would try to roll them over to change the sheets he could somehow launch into an angry tirade and how horrible we were and that he never wanted to see me in his house again.

Soon, I found my pop pop telling me secrets, holding my hand when he could, and I will awkwardly admit, he grabbed my butt. 

But over time, he slowly forgot that my grandmother wasn‚Äôt around anymore. He thought I was her. He would tell me how much he loved me and how his kids were doing great. Toward the end, I stopped correcting him and pretended to be the person he thought I was. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to remind him of another thing he lost."
r/askreddit,"I live in California and my parents live in Florida.  I talk to my mom on the phone almost every day, and my dad maybe once a week?  The first thing I noticed was that he was quieter on the phone.  Then it seemed like he was always trying to get off the phone instead of engaging in conversation.  My dad is a TALKER so this was all weird.  I told my mom I thought maybe he was depressed again and needed to see someone to have his meds adjusted.  Then he started bringing home the wrong things from the grocery store, and one day had a hard time getting cash from an ATM.  My mom said he was starting to ask her the same questions over and over, which was exactly what his father, my grandfather, had been doing 25 years ago.  We knew then whatever was going on was bad.  It turned out he has Parkinsons that manifested with *some* tremors, but mostly with these memory problems / cognitive issues.  So he can't drive anymore (he'll get lost for one thing), and when he gets outside his daily routine his deficits really show.

Edit: More about our lives changed: he has been hospitalized several times for issues not related to the Parkinsons but he absolutely can't be left alone in the hospital because he gets anxious and he will get up and walk around when it isn't safe.  I am an only child, so I had to go home to help my mom several times last year.  I take the night shift at the hospital, she goes home, and then we switch in the morning.  It has also been incredibly isolating.  He can't work anymore, and work was his whole life.  He doesn't want to go anywhere really without my mom or me if I am there, because he gets anxious.  My mom is in therapy now for the first time in decades, and they are getting ready to move very soon from their house of 31 years to a retirement village where there is more safety, activity, and help for my mom if/when she needs it."

I thought we was just annoying when I was a kid, but looking back at it and knowing about it now, it was very obvious."
r/askreddit,"My mom has schizophrenia and it gets increasingly worse - but she already displayed symptoms long before I was born. A few things I noticed is her obsessive fixations on things. Once, my siblings and I listened in on her talking on the phone - she had 3 sentences that she kept repeating in a loop, she said each at least a dozen times. Once she falls into a delusion, she'll sooner kill you than admit she's wrong; if you show her proof, she'll close her eyes and turn her head, and if you read it out loud she will literally put her fingers in her ears and scream at the top of her lungs. It seems that challenging her delusions causes her deep, painful anguish. She also always jumps to conclusions without facts, and she claims she doesn't need facts as her ""little angels"" told her the truth - why research it when absolute truth is available to her? It took me a few years to figure out she literally sees ""angels,"" she hallucinates that God's envoys talk to her because she is special. Sometimes, she will stare at nothing and talk with an angel only she can see. It's creepy.

The creepi*er* part is that I was conceived through incest and schizophrenia was passed down to me. I take it seriously and avoid delusions the best I can, but the disease is just starting to spread (I got formally diagnosed with it just two years ago). It will get increasingly worse as I get older, and it scares me so, so much. I don't want to end up like my mother..."

I have 2 stories, one from my father in law (who is still alive) and the other is from my great aunt in law who passed away last year.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my husband for 15 years. My husband's father got diagnosed about 8 or so years ago. Before, he's always had memory troubles but he was the most pleasant person I've ever met. As things got worse, he got more angry. Once the official Alzheimer's diagnosis got attached, he was put on some medication and that helped for a long while. (He's on different meds now that the disease has progressed.)

&amp;#x200B;

The great aunt in law was also very pleasant, up until about a year before she died. She then used to curse out my mother in law (it was her mother's sister who also was like... her second mother, basically as the great aunt had no children. Mother in law promised she'd take care of her in her dying years, and she did just that.) on a regular basis which made the mother in law both stressed out and sad. On top of taking care of the great aunt and her husband, she was (and still is) working. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year and a half ago we picked up our family and moved out to where the in laws were to at first help my mother in law take care of the great aunt, but it has blossomed to help take care of my father in law too as he has had some severe drops since we moved here. Towards the end with the great aunt, she didn't remember what year it was, and didn't recognize me or my children. Still, I wouldn't have changed experiencing that for the world. She was 99, with 3 months before turning 100 when she died. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always really enjoyed speaking with my father in law; however now he doesn't say much. He can't really handle more than a couple of people around. He sleeps quite a bit, and shakes more than he used to. He also used to get really angry which was uncharacteristic of him. Thankfully, whatever current meds he's on has been helping with that, the nightmares, and the hallucinations.

&amp;#x200B;

We've talked to my husband's other siblings and they all agree that they're glad someone in the family is taking the helm at watching the parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's really a tough job taking care of someone you love who doesn't remember who you are, or who doesn't behave the way they used to. On top of that, the cognitive dysfunction and sometimes the outright combativeness of the loved one can really wear on someone. I think it's imperative to have others come in and at least give the primary caregiver a break; or have an ear for them to vent at without judgement. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother in law has said that she is in mourning for the person that was my father in law but isn't anymore. They'll be celebrating their 50th anniversary in June.

r/askreddit,"My grandfather had lewy body dementia and Alzheimer's  which the doctor said is the worst kind of dementia. In the span of about 3 years he went from being a completely normal old person to slowly loosing his short term memory. Like where we were going or doing. To eventually his long term memory. He forget names, faces, ect... the heartbreaking lart was he was unable to remember my mother who spent the last 5 years helping him at his house all the time. Every now an again youd get a day where he would remember things but those kept happening less and less He went to a home the last year and a half and got to the point where he couldnt talk. He would be emotionless, youd have to feed him, and he wouldnt do anything but sit there. It was so sad. Then one day we got the call that he had less than a few hours to live. He went into a coma and never woke up and stopped breathing before i could get to the home. That was 2 years ago and i still remember the events of that day."
r/askreddit,"My grandmother has dementia - it‚Äôs pretty advanced now. At the beginning, it started with little things like her forgetting ingredients in recipes she had made for years. I remember eating over at her place for supper and having sweet spaghetti because the recipe she had made for years she had forgotten. Then we noticed things like her misplacing her glasses, keys, remotes, etc. Slowly, her personality started changing - especially in regards to her refusing to go out in social interactions as she was embarrassed she would look ‚Äústupid‚Äù (her own words). 

It was really tough on my family. My father and his brother were not very close to begin with but many instances led to a lot of resentment and frustration. This has led to emotional distance within the family due to my uncle at first refusing to acknowledge the situation with his mom, then minimizing it, and then not helping when the situation worsened. It has also led to a lot of financial and emotional stress on my parents.

On a personal note, it was really rough and it actually led to me getting access to a therapist and psychologist for my anxiety. Part of my grandmothers dementia leads her to believe that her abusive father is still alive (he passed away about 30 years ago) and she thinks that her husband (my grandfather) is him. This has caused her to threaten to kill herself, hurt my grandfather, and has even led to her being physically abusive to my grandfather. This was very tough on me, especially as I was a nursing student (now a nurse) and felt that it was my ‚Äòresponsibility‚Äô to protect my family. Unfortunately when the thing that is threatening your family can‚Äôt be treated or cured it can be emotionally, spiritually, mentally and even physically exhausting."
r/askreddit,"My gram has dementia. I noticed gram talking about the distant past more and more and not really talking about the recent past. She would have trouble with things that happened a month ago or so. Also started calling her oldest daughter by grams sisters name. At first it was every now and then when my aunt wasnt present. Then started happening more and more. I was just a ""kid"" what do I know was the response I got from everyone when I expressed my concerns. I was like 22 or so when I really started noticing. No one wanted to listen to me, my mom was the one taking gram to all her appointments and apparently the neurologist was doing the same test every time to test for dementia and alzheimers. Well gram remembered all the answers long before any symptoms showed up and they weren't something she forgot. I begged her to ask the doc to try something different. Ofc it did nothing. It wasnt until her personality really started to change that anyone else took notice. By then it was far too late. My gram doesnt remember me anymore and really only remembers my mom. It breaks my heart we used to do everything together. It's a hard thing to witness."
r/askreddit,"My mom was hit with a stroke after she had fell many times at her workplace. She sold fresh chicken at a morning market for many years. Some customers said she didn't give the proper change,doesn't remember the way back to our house,her cooking changed,her mouth was slopsided. There was 1 time where we saw our mom getting dressed,went to the car&amp;sat at the passenger's seat. It was really heartbreaking because she survived on her own for 7 years after our dad passed away. Soon after,our lives changed gradually to her talking gibberish,she lost sense on her right side. It had been going on for 7 years more until her passing. Very satisfied to care for her until the very end. Miss you so much,ma ‚ù§"
r/askreddit,"Hi there,

My mother has very advanced Multiple Sclerosis and Dementia.  She is now cared for by a full time nursing home staff as my Pop and I can't.  Mom mother became very childlike as in: not properly toileting, bathing or being able to understand adult/complex conversations or movies.  She didn't like to read anymore and she once tore through books voraciously, however, she know longer could remember what she'd read previously or understood plots.  She became angry or irritated with me and my Dad for very simple things.  

She started to threaten self harm out of frustration of forgetting.

She forgot words, people places and things more and more. And it was more obvious when she'd point to something she wanted because the word for the object was escaping her.  Her dementia went undiagnosed for quite sometime because ""brain fog"" and other forgetful ways are also part of MS."
r/askreddit,"My Gran has vascular dementia, it‚Äôs pretty early on but is getting noticeably worse.   
Christmas we were all sitting round the table, eating dinner. Everyone pulls their crackers and she gets a little animal toy. I can‚Äôt remember what it was, but let‚Äôs say a sheep. She pipes up with ‚Äúoh look, I‚Äôve got an octopus!‚Äù. Bare in mind we all know about her diagnoses, but she either doesn‚Äôt remember the doctors meeting or has blocked it from her mind, because she thinks she‚Äôs fine. So everyone gets a bit quiet, some nervous laughter as someone says:  
‚Äúno Gran, that‚Äôs a sheep...‚Äù  
‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs an octopus.‚Äù  
‚ÄúGran it‚Äôs a sheep, octopus have 8 legs...‚Äù
She starts getting angry, just repeating that it‚Äôs an octopus. We all decide to just let it go. 

I was living with her for a few months, partly because I needed somewhere to stay while I got back on my feet, and partly because she was getting to the point of needing help with day to day things.   
So a month or 2 after Christmas, she asks me if I could run to the shop to get a few things. She always insists on paying, so she starts going through her purse to get coins out. After fishing a few out, she holds up a ¬£2 coin and says:  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù  
‚Äú...what?‚Äù  
‚ÄúWhat is this!?‚Äù  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs... it‚Äôs a coin..?‚Äù  
‚ÄúWHAT IS THIS WORTH!?‚Äù  
‚Äú...¬£2...‚Äù  
‚ÄúThank you‚Äù

And everything proceeds as normal. 

There‚Äôs plenty of others but those 2 stand out. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve reset her bank info, even though she always writes the new info down. How many times I‚Äôll gently say ‚ÄúGran we‚Äôve had this conversation, word for word twice already today...‚Äù  
The problem is as I said, she insists she‚Äôs fine, that she‚Äôs always prided herself on her good memory. Add in a personality that can never admit is wrong and it leads to some frustrating, but mostly just very sad conversations. 

Watching what was once this fiercely independent woman who feared nothing deteriorate into a frail, confused person who‚Äôs too scared to leave the house is heart breaking. But that‚Äôs the illness, it is what it is. Her husband died 4 years ago, one son lives 200 miles away, the other (my Dad) is so busy with work that he‚Äôs barely got time to sleep, never mind going over and helping her every day. I‚Äôve been helping her for a while, but I‚Äôve just landed a great job and have moved cities, so she‚Äôs back on her own again. She needs help, but if you try to bring it up she gets angry and shuts the conversation down. 

And the worst part, is that this is just the beginning. It‚Äôs only going to get much worse."
r/askreddit,"My grandfather died of Alzheimer's. Some things happened early in his diagnosis that were sad but also kind of interesting. For example, he would say ""Damn"" a lot, which before then he would rarely ever say. Pre-diagnosis he would also put Tabasco on every piece of food he ate. After diagnosis, he would still put the tabasco on, but complain about how spicy it was and would refuse to eat it. He'd also confuse hot and cold."
r/askreddit,"My mother has early on set. She first started showing signs when I was in high school- which was 15+ years ago. She was just so mean- wanted to fight about everything, control everything. It was a really tough time but I think my father and I chalked it up to me being an asshole teenager and her being an overbearing mother (and we were both only children). Anyway it just never stopped. And she started forgetting things and getting angrier and angrier. Would act out, lie, it was just terrible to be honest. By the time we got the diagnosis it was a miracle because we finally had a reason for her behavior. She declined very rapidly afterwards. She‚Äôs in a home now because we just couldn‚Äôt take care of her safely anymore."
r/askreddit,"Sorry for bad typos/grammar, my English isn‚Äôt the best. I‚Äôm also on mobile. 
My grandfather passed away a couple of days before Christmas, but was in the early stages of dementia beforehand. He‚Äôd get touchy over things, for example he‚Äôd forgotten he‚Äòd had his dinner and insisted on more food at the rest home, hours after they‚Äôd served the food. When they offered him something else he‚Äôd shout no, only wanting what was on the menu (that he‚Äôd already eaten, and there was no more of). He‚Äôd also forget who came to visit him, his brother would often drive for hours to spend an hour with him, and myself and nearby family would see him often too but he just wouldn‚Äôt remember. He always thought he‚Äôd be going back to his original home, which was sold years prior to pay for the rest home. Near the end he began to speak of my grandmother, who passed away 15 years ago, and asking where she was. In fact that was the last thing he spoke of before he went to sleep and never woke up. What he did remember was sweet, though, he‚Äôd always recall where my cousins and I were at in our lives, and what we were doing. He‚Äôd also recount his military days, and my mother and aunties childhoods. It was tough needing to fill in the gaps for him, and it definitely did wear him out as you could tell he struggled to think and remember. I sometimes think if I had sat with him more often to talk maybe he would have never forgotten, and now that he has passed I wish I spent more time with him."
r/askreddit,"My grandmother died about two years ago from Alzheimer‚Äôs. She was diagnosed in 2010 while she was living by herself in Florida (same house she‚Äôs always lived in and where my dad grew up). I noticed something was off when I received 3 birthday cards from her in about 7 days. I told my dad, and he immediately became concerned. My uncle, who still lives in that area, then started to check in on her every so often and when he saw something was odd that‚Äôs when he took her to a doctor. 

Her case was just severe enough to where her doctor wasn‚Äôt comfortable with her living alone. My aunt and uncle did their best to look after her In Florida but it took a heavy toll due to my grandmother having a hard time understanding what was going on, and she was the type to let you know what was on her mind and not in a nice way. She DID grow up in NYC after all lol. 

A decision was made to move her into a facility closer to my dad in 2012. He took over her finances and such, so any type of cold call or telemarking scam that would normally go to her was redirected to my dads phone, and because she constantly donated to things without realizing it, he had to manage a lot of calls and cancel a lot of prescriptions or mail ordered items. 

My siblings and I would go see her every so often with our parents and we could immediately tell she wasn‚Äôt the same. She still had a very quick wit and was quick to correct our grammar, but our conversations usually started to become cyclical. She would ask us the same questions, the typical things you‚Äôd experience in talking with someone with the disease. But the strange thing was, despite her illness, she was still highly active. She still wanted to go on walks or drive around the city and we would do just that every once in awhile. 

But things got bad a few months in. Conversations that used to take an hour or so, took 15-20 minutes before she started asking the same questions again. She started to wake up not knowing where she was and would panic. Sometimes she would call my dad at 2 or 3 in the morning scared to death. At one point, she just walked out of the facility without anyone noticing until she got to the other side of the parking lot. So she was moved to a facility that was more secure and had 24/7 staff. 

Over the next 4 years her condition deteriorated. My dad went from seeing her multiple times a week, to once a week, to a couple of times a month. If we ever took her somewhere, it was no longer a day long affair, but more like an hour or two. NOT because my dad couldn‚Äôt handle it, but because the doctors told him she was reaching a stage where it would be best for family to keep their distance in order to not upset or confuse her. We would go see her for birthdays and holidays and such, but each passing occasion you could tell she barely knew what was going on, despite being %100 healthy otherwise. About 6 months before she died, we visited her and she didn‚Äôt recognize me or my little brother, and we were both well into our 20s. She recognized my dad and asked who we were. She would always say the same thing to us: ‚Äúit‚Äôs nice to know I have such fine, handsome grandsons‚Äù and I would always joke back ‚Äúyeah, good looks must skip a generation in this family‚Äù to rib at my dad and she LOVED that joke...

She was starting to have heart and kidney problems around that time, too. The night she died, she fell and broke her hip. And she was rushed to the hospital where she eventually passed. Doctors said at that point her body was going through so much, it basically shut down. 

My dad said this after she died: ‚ÄúI would have rather her died instantly and painlessly than have her go through what she did the last 5 years.‚Äù My dad, with the help of my mom, handled the situation with my grandmother spectacularly. He was more content with her death than sad because he knew what his mom was going through was hell. I will never forget how great my dad handled everything. 

I learned that when loved ones are going through the stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs, it‚Äôs important to understand that there will be extreme highs and lows. Embrace the highs while you can. It won‚Äôt happen very often that he/she is back to their normal self. It may be for a few hours, or it might be for a day or two so embrace and take advantage of it. And be patient with them in the lows. They‚Äôre scared. They don‚Äôt know where they are or why everyone around them looks older and/or different. Being stern or annoyed with their constant questions won‚Äôt calm them down. You must calmly and directly explain their situation to them. 

Alzheimer‚Äôs is an ugly disease that, unfortunately, only gets worse. What helped my mom and dad out was contacting people who were going through the same situation. 

If you are someone who is experiencing this (and you happened to read this whole thing lol), I highly recommend you to get in touch with people or a support group to help you though these tough times. Also, remember that your loved one is suffering from a disease that impacts their memory and sometimes their personality. If they act mean, rude, or out of character, it is the disease talking, not them. Love and care for them during these times, and when their time comes, remember them as the person they were before the disease. :)"
r/askreddit,My Nan started to tell the same stories or ask the same questions several times on the same day.
r/askreddit,"My dad has vascular dementia which is similar to Alzheimers. He used to travel all the time, but he started getting confused about the days and times he was supposed to leave so we started getting really concerned about him. He missed a lot of flights. One day he called to say he was coming to visit - that same afternoon (at that time we lived on the west coast about 1500 miles away from him)! 

He also got taken by a phone scammer that defied logic. The caller told my dad that he was my son and that he'd been jailed and needed bail money wired to some number in New Jersey. Instead of calling me about it to check he simply sent the money, and even after that he didn't call me to check up on my son. I didn't learn about it until I called him about something unrelated 12 hours later, and he casually said something like ""glad I could help your son out."" ""What are you talking about Dad?""

But the worst change was that his personality became quite different. Not going to go into a lot of detail, but when your dad goes from being a perfect gentleman to saying really out of character sexual remarks, shit gets weird. That part was the most difficult."
r/askreddit,"Dad is in his early 60's, was diagnosed a little over a year ago. We noticed when he started having trouble reading, but his vision isn't bad. Didn't think a whole lot of it until he was having trouble playing a fairly simple board game my family has been playing for decades. He now can't follow sentences or read well, math is out of the question, and anything involving more than a few steps in a process is difficult, including getting ready in the morning. He's still driving and going to his favorite sports events by himself, but that's not going to continue much longer. No issues recognizing family or friends, or old memories, but lots of trouble finding words or explaining pretty much anything. It has already been difficult and will get a lot worse. Luckily, myself and my brother live in the same town as my parents and can help out when necessary."

r/askreddit,"My grandma used to be a wonderful cook but started making errors with her classic family favourite dishes. She also would call my mom and ask questions like, i havent made my meatballs in a long time... how did I get them to stay together so well again?"
r/askreddit,I wish I did notice more things but I was only 8 when he got sick. I noticed he wasn't feedings us normal meals. At 11 he didn't know who I was and 14 he died. It gave me a lot of abandon issues having your dad look at your and ask who you are.
r/askreddit,"I noticed my grandmother developing Alzheimer‚Äôs when we were on holiday. The first signs were that she would often forget our plans for that day, she was in a separate room to us and would forget to meet us at a certain place before going out or forget what time to meet us. At dinner, she would forget what she ordered, ask when the waiter was coming to take our order when we had just ordered or ask when the food was coming minutes after we had ordered. 

From that she became gradually worse and my dad took on caring duties, making sure to visit her and find her suitable support. But it was after she ended up in hospital for gallstones that we noticed a huge difference and suddenly she became a hundred times worse, it was a huge shift. She started to become a risk to herself-fiddling with the electrics, forgetting that she had food cooking, forgetting to turn the stove off. We looked after her everyday, but it was hard because we didn‚Äôt have the means to move her into our home. The support we hired helped a bit, but her nurse wasn‚Äôt always there and the cleaner we hired ended up taking advantage of her and overcharging her. She ended up forgetting the names of her children and grandchildren. Her friends in the area all died within two years, and sometimes she‚Äôd forget that they did, which was horrible to have to remind her and see her heart break again every time, and we eventually just lied and said her friends were away whenever she asked about them. She would make up stories as well, some being quite serious

It changed her so much, she changed from this witty, churchgoing, active old lady to someone so fragile and vulnerable. It was difficult to watch because she had always been so independent and always prided herself on that. I found it really difficult. I was in school at that time (around 13-14) and often found myself at her house straight after school to look after her. It was hard to process that she wasn‚Äôt really the same person I knew her as, kind of like having to mourn someone who‚Äôs still alive; it‚Äôs very strange and painful. I felt a lot of guilt because I didn‚Äôt feel like I valued the time I had with her enough before she got ill. I struggled a lot with eating when I was younger and she was always the first person to pick up on my eating behaviours when no one else in my family noticed, which kind of made me resent her a bit, which led to a lot of feelings of guilt and anger towards myself afterwards.  We ended up putting her in a care home, which was the hardest decision but none of our family members had the means to provide constant 24/7 on the clock care for her, which is what she desperately needed. There‚Äôs a lot of stigma around care homes, but it was the best for her. She struggled a lot with loneliness, even though we visited her everyday, the moment we left her house she would forget we even visited at all. Now she doesn‚Äôt have that, she‚Äôs constantly surrounded with people and finally has friends again. It‚Äôs a private care home, which is so expensive, but she‚Äôs being provided with things we couldn‚Äôt have given her. Whenever we see her, she‚Äôs smiling and we know she‚Äôs being looked after and that‚Äôs all we could ask for. Our conversations are almost always the same every time we see her, she asks the same questions every five minutes. She did initially get into some trouble when she first moved into her care home because she could be quite aggressive when she was confused and we almost had to move her, but it isn‚Äôt as bad now. 

I‚Äôm 20 now and she‚Äôs still alive, and the biggest worry I have is that I‚Äôm starting to forget what she was like before all of this, and I‚Äôm scared that when she passes the memories that I have of her will predominantly be of her being unwell, and not the memories of her being well and being the person I grew up with. Alzheimer‚Äôs is difficult, it‚Äôs hard and painful. I cry every time after I visit my grandma because it‚Äôs hard seeing someone you love like that. I‚Äôm thankful that she still remembers her family, she doesn‚Äôt remember names, but will remember faces. But I try to remember the good times, that she‚Äôs an extraordinary woman who still loves me and always will."
r/askreddit,"My father had a form of dementia brought on by Diabetes. It was gradual and patchy and it started by exaggerating what he already was. I saw the tiny signs not long after he retired age 65, but they got worse over the years and he died age 88. Even then he was not totally taken over by the dementia and the original version would appear for a few moments.

Some small very early signs; 
He took instructions very literally, so if the instant coffee jar said to use freshly boiled water, he would empty the full kettle that my mother had boiled five minutes before, refill it and use it the moment it came to the boil. 

He liked the cream from the top of the milk and used it. My mother showed me four new bottles of milk in the fridge, all opened and the cream gone.

He had always been careful with money, but he suddenly would only shop in Charity shops and discount places. He would use ordinary shops for some things but would go without if what he wanted was not on special offer.

Before he retired he would walk everywhere including the two plus miles to work and then the return. He was given a bus pass and said it was a waste of money not to use it and did so for everything. 

When he retired he took on doing the washing up to help my mother. It gradually took longer and longer because he loved rainbows and used to make as many bubbles as possible to see the rainbows in them. We had the cleanest milk bottles ever.

There were other signs, but they almost all added up to a slightly worse version of my dad. One about face that he did was that his taste buds changed and he rediscovered foods that he once disliked and now loved. All of my life he had hated gravy. If my mother made a casserole she would have to fish a portion of meat out before she served it so it could be drained for him. Towards the end she had to make two jugs of gravy, one for dad and the other for everyone else."
r/askreddit,"My Grandmother is just about to be diagnosed with Dementia. I was always very close to her as we are practically next door neighbours. 

Honestly, she stopped driving about 2 or 3 years ago and after that it started happening VERY slowly. Becoming a little forgetful, but hey, who doesn't at her age, right? 

Then, all of a sudden between Autumn last year and right now, she cant even write her own signature. It all happened so fast. I mean seriously fast. 

She started off forgetting where light switches were and when she couldn't find them, she'd say they were broken. Then she had trouble using household appliances like the oven and washing machine. Now, her short term memory is very bad. She's still good with names but she cant remember things like what she had for dinner or for breakfast. She says she's eating a lot but we know she's not, so we make her dinner most nights and put it on the table for her so she eats it. 

Just this last week, she forgot how to write her own signature. I got a birthday card from her yesterday and what was supposed to say ""Granny"" was just bunch of jumbled up letters. 

It's really sad to see her deteriorate like this. She no longer engages in any meaningful conversation or with crowds. It's only going to get worse for her."
r/askreddit,My grandma was confused who's wedding we were going to. She was convinced one of my older family members was getting remarried when it actually was his son getting married. Little things like that were just a little wrong. Then it turned to just random things she made up in her head. Like I died and my dad was in jail and my cousin was getting married. Just mind was on random. It was super scary to see. Her long term memory is perfect but her new memories are changing as they are being formed.
r/askreddit,"I watched my grandpa develop alzheimer's. My grandparents raised me, so they are closer to being my mom and dad than my biological parents are. 

I was pretty young when it started, but the first few things I noticed was that he didn't know what year it was anymore. He usually thought we were in the 80s still when questioned. He also had this particular cup that he would use for coffee every morning. He started to put it in really odd spots, and then not being able to find it. 

If you asked him about anything from the first 40 years of his life though, he could recall it like it was yesterday. When I was in high school I had to write a paper about a grandparent. I interviewed my grandpa about his time in WWII, and it was the most coherent I had ever seen him in my life. It's a moment I will never forget, and I actually still have a transcript I made of the interview + the paper I wrote. 

Near the end of his life I was no longer ""my name"" anymore, but ""name of one of his daughters"". It didn't bother me; I'd rather he recognize me as a family member, than as a stranger. Every time I would leave the house I would say bye to him, and he would reply with, ""Take it easy.""

Honestly, the life I saw him live while I was growing up didn't change much due to the Alzheimer's. He was always active outside, and would tinker in the garage daily. I really think having hobbies helped a lot, and he seemed content. 

As for myself, it was basically just helping him find things, listening to him more, and making sure he didn't try to do anything dangerous. (When he was 90 he tried to get on the roof to push leaves and debris off of it!) He just didn't want to give up his previous responsibilities. 

My grandpa lived a long life, and passed away at the age of 94. He declined quickly over just a few months, and passed in his sleep at home. I was 23 when he died, so I really only ever knew this version of him. I never viewed him as crazy, or even old. He was my grandpa; one of the people who raised me, and alzheimer's can't change that."

I asked her repeatedly to just check her wallet then to see it the $100 bill was still there or not. She just kept yelling she didn't need to check because she knew she'd given it to me.

Eventually she checked and all the anger just blew out of her. She was mortified, the $100 bill was there. Bitch."
r/askreddit,"Not cashier but (now ex) bartender - and this was a while ago so I may not have everything that's said 100% correct. 

Right after we closed one Friday or Saturday night I was sent to sweep up a broken glass that happened to be next to a table where a couple of girls were still sat finishing their last drinks (the DJ had just stopped playing music, bouncers were in the process of asking everyone to leave) a lot of the broken glass happened to be under where one of the girls was sitting so I politely said ""please can I ask you to move so I can sweep up this broken glass"" she gave me a really dirty look, downed her drink, threw her glass on the floor next to her (so I now had twice as much to sweep up), and said ""you can't make me move anywhere""

""BITCH GET OUT, WE'RE CLOSED AND I ALREADY ASKED YOU POLITELY""

My manager heard, came over and asked what happened, i told him and he just went ""OK, you're barred"" to the girl, it was so satisfying when she tried arguing with him and he got the bouncers to escort her from the building."

One day I had enough and took his sandwich I was in the middle of making and spiked it into the garbage can and told him to fuck off. He told me I couldn't talk to customers that way and I told him ""I just did you retard"". He called the owner and dropped my name (we had name tags) and she told him that if i blew up on him like that it was probably deserved and asked him to not return. I for sure thought I was fired.

The next day she came in and before she even hit the register she announced very rudely in my general direction, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making my drink, right?‚Äù  


I switched places with the person on bar in order to make it. As her drink was so wildly complicated, it took several minutes to make, throughout which I was told how terrible her drink had been yesterday, how it had ruined her day, how she‚Äôd lost faith in the company, etc. I apologized profusely and offered to comp her drink. That was not good enough. She told me she wanted the person who had made her drink before fired.  


I... lost my temper. I more or less told her that I was sorry that her drink was not up to par the day before, but that I had apologized, offered a free beverage and had actually warned her we were having an equipment issue the day before, which was the likely culprit and not my employee.  


She told me I must have woken up on the wrong side of the bed and I said no, actually you are a giant pain in the ass, your order is obnoxious and we bend over backwards to accommodate you daily (she had a whole list of things aside from the crazy drink; it had to be served with a certain number of napkins, her sleeve had to be facing a specific way, etc) and if that‚Äôs how you feel please take your business elsewhere.  


Coffee Umbridge tut tutted her way out of my shop in a huff and I didn‚Äôt even care if I got in trouble for telling her off (I didn‚Äôt)."
r/askreddit,"This wasn't me, but I was involved. When I was in highschool I worked at a shoe store. The one with that fucking prize wheel from hell. We did this ""buy one get one half off"" sale all the time. The way it works is you buy a more expensive pair and you get the cheaper of the two half off, otherwise we'd lose money. So this woman comes in and buys two pair of kids shoes. Looks at the receipt and thinks that 50 dollars is too much for her smaller child. So she returns them. She then proceeds to flip out because the difference for the other pair came out of the refund. I called the manager and he came up and she says "" he's a foster kid. He's not worth a 50 dollar pair of shoes, stop trying to rob me and give me my fucking money"" so manager refunded her the entire bill and took both pair of shoes and walked off. We all gave her the silent treatment until she left, angrily. I feel bad for both children and her husband who were just standing there quietly."
r/askreddit,"I carded a woman trying to buy cigarettes who got really bitchy when I didn't just give it to her. It was in her car so she left &amp; came right back. When I held my hand out for it she tried to fling it at my face &amp; missed. It fell on the floor behind the counter &amp; I refused to pick it up. I called for next customer &amp; started ignoring her. When she asked for it back I gave her permission to come around the counter to get it. It was petty, but in the moment I wasn't gonna budge. She called the cops &amp; said I stole it. When they came I explained what happened, he gave her a really annoyed look &amp; she yells ""Make him give it to me!"" then looks back to me. He literally ordered me to pick it up. I'd honestly rather lose my job but I was afraid of what would happen if I refused an officer. So I picked it up and gave it to her. She got the satisfaction of winning, and got to leave with a big smug look on her face. Afterwards the officer apologized &amp; said he was basically afraid of upsetting her. I was dangerously close to calling him a pussy."

r/askreddit,"i honestly don't remember this, but my coworkers do, and apparently was a customer yelled at me, ""go to hell!"" and i yelled back, ""i'll see you there!"" my sis and i say this to each other a lot (for funsies) and it's the only reason i believe i may have said this to an inrate customer. 

But one i did remember was a customer brought up a sandwich that apparently looked awful to her. she held it out to me and said, ""would you eat this???"" and without missing a beat i said, ""yes."" that shocked her into silence for a good few seconds. i was being honest, the sandwich looked fine to me."
r/askreddit,"I think you'd get better answers if you asked, ""what was the worst time you *wanted* to blow up on a customer?"" I would get fired if I ever actually blew up on anyone and I think many cashiers are in the same bite-your-tongue-and-smile situation, which only invites abuse from assholes.

A few weeks ago my manager told me we'd get some people coming through the restaurant who were owed free meals because they had a complaint about one of the ingredients in meals they'd had previously. It was already kind of ridiculous because of the details of it but we were like whatever, we'll give em what they want. They come in and proceed to order the most expensive meals you can get, totaling over $50 for three people. Because of how the restaurant works, the food was ready before they get to me, the cashier. They kept ""remembering"" things they claimed they'd had last time, and after some thought I tried to get them to pay the $15 or whatever for their sides and stuff because I was only supposed to comp their meals, but they claimed they didn't even have a form of payment with them. None of the three of them. Riiiight.

The smug, satisfied look on their faces killed me. I wanted to punch the main guy's punchable fucking face. Like, it had no effect on me personally, but it was just such a scummy, shameless thing to do I couldn't help feeling that way. I just bit my tongue and followed my (clearly pissed) manager's instructions. I didn't blow up on them, the most I did is not wish them a good day as I usually would. And because of that I still have my job."

r/askreddit,I was a server years ago and this woman (usually a pretty nice lady) comes in and apparently we had messed up her salmon a few days prior so the manager had given her a free meal card which is good for one single meal. Well a few days later she comes in with at least fifteen people about an hour before we closed and they all order seafood and steak and wine and her whole party is awful to me and My friend who is another server. One guest even threw his plate on the ground breaking it and throwing food all over because his steak was over cooked. After all of this the other server went to take the woman her check and it was a couple hundred dollars and she WHIPS OUT THE FREE MEAL CARD. The server takes it to the register comps one of the meals off and comes back with the new total and the woman loses it. ‚ÄúI have a free meal card! This was one meal for all of us! It should be free!‚Äù And the server just stiffens up and politely explains that that isn‚Äôt how it works and stresses that she had to have known that she couldn‚Äôt have brought fifteen people in here and expected free meals for everyone. The woman stands up and pours her red wine all over my friend and my friend just goes WHAT THE FUCK and runs to the back to get the manager. She kept her calm honestly but the manager flipped and told her to get the hell out and never come back. That was a crazy night.

I tell people calmly that we won‚Äôt be filling controls for them early because no one is willing to lose their license over their Norco/Percocet/benzo of choice/Adderall.

They lose their minds.

I didn‚Äôt yell at him, I leaned across the counter and told him, in a quiet tone of voice, ‚ÄúNo, your non-compliance and rage issues will be what kills you. And I will never, ever serve you again. You don‚Äôt get to scream at me, and you certainly don‚Äôt get to refer to me the way you have and expect anything from me.‚Äù

He called me a bitch (after calling me everything but a child of God, I fucking hate overly dramatic assholes), and I told him, ‚ÄúI may be a bitch, but I am not your bitch, and you still aren‚Äôt getting your way.

r/askreddit,"I only ever lost it on a customer once, when I was working at an office supply store.

Customer was one of those self-important money-pusher types. Came in during the lunch rush on a day when we were short handed. He wanted to buy a phone. I normally would have helped him, but I was stuck on register.

I did everything I could to help this guy anyway. When I was finally able to focus on him exclusively, he launched into a lecture along the lines of how he specifically was the most important person in the store. And I lost it.

I barely remember what I said to guy. I know I tried to walk away first, but he pushed it. I ended up tearing into him so badly he basically ran from the store, and the assistant manager on duty was too stunned to do anything about the incident.

I hated that job. Quit, not long after."

As I'm ringing him up he asks for a bag, I say okie dokie and continue to finish the part of the transaction I was currently working. He asks for a bag again, I figure he didn't hear me the first time so I say it again, a little it louder, but continue to do finish the transaction first.

When he asks for a bag the third time I straight up say okay while looking at him dead in the face. He asks me what okie dokie means and if I speak English. Being that I'm like, seventh(?) generation American and white as fresh fallen snow I'm genuinely surprised that this dude has never heard the phrase okie dokie and proceed to tell him that yes I speak English and that okie dokie is slang.

At that point he starts throwing coins to pay for this dam bottle of soda off the counter at me and I just snap. I void the transaction, remove his soda from my register and tell him that I'm refusing him service.

Dude pushes back a little bit but surprisingly doesn't demand my manager and eventually just leaves.

The only time I've ever came close to just obliterating a customer and quitting on the spot was when some bitch dropped the ""The customer is always right"" line in an angry tirade at me in front of my manager over her misunderstanding what I said. More specifically when she dropped the ""I write your paycheck"" line right after the 'customer' line.

I said she will be the next after I take care of this customer. When it was her turn she started going off on me that it was rude of me to not help her... blah blah blah. I ignored her as much as possible. She kept going on and on until I said ""lady I opened this register as a favor so the wait time would be shorter. If you would rather wait in one of the regular register lines you are more than welcome"". She was shocked that I talked back to her.. she didnt realize that I was the Manager. She found one of the employees who was stocking a shelf in the candy Isle and damanded that she speak to a Manager. That employee called for a Manager over the intercom and I happily walked over to candy Isle to see her waiting for a Manager. With a big smile on my face I let her know I was the Manager on Duty.

Now, the restaurant had this piece of protocol in which you confirm the desired items as you punch them in. Just helping the customer be absolutely sure about their order and that I put it in correctly. I punch something in and try to confirm the previous item, sparking a rather annoyed ‚Äúyes.‚Äù Fuck no. I wasn‚Äôt getting paid to be bitched out for doing what I‚Äôm told. I knew I had to shut her attitude down before it got worse. So, I responded with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just checking‚Äù in an equally annoyed tone. We then made eye contact, her expression borderline angry and mine vacant and blank. I didn‚Äôt want to escalate the situation with my facial expression. The transaction proceeded without incident.

But this one guy. I know he was homeless and had a disability of some kind (although I can't be sure what since he seemed coherent and capable of picking up heavy items he wanted), but after seeing him come into my store night after night with not enough change, constantly repeating what the price of a 2 liter of Mountain Dew was while someone was standing at the register, and finally wanting to buy beer and cigars, I had enough. I told him flat out with a line full of people one night that it was the last time I wanted to see him in my store and to never come back. I refused to sell beer to him or cigars without an ID, which he never had on him, ever. He got pissy and left saying he wasn't gonna be back.

In the evenings the staff is supposed to put away all the misplaced product back on the shelves, Facing I think it was called. We would organize it by aisle then take each basket and put everything away, standard stuff.

Anyway I show up in the morning and it's only me and my Bitch boss, entitled and disrespectful. there were supposed to be 5 of us for the shift but we had 3 no-shows or sick call ins. All the merch from the night before that was supposed to be put away was still not done.

So it was only me and my boss, with extra work from the night before, luckily it wasn't too busy but my boss decides that she'll sit on register (with no customers) while I put away all the merch from the night before. Fine, she has seniority and I'd rather be doing something than nothing.

r/askreddit,"Okay hold onto your hats ladies and gentlemen. I work in a place that is funded by a University. Basically, all the small walk in customers don‚Äôt make us money nor do we need them. This gives me a little lee way when it comes to customer service. So we had this old guy that would come in and print stuff. (We are a print center). Anyways, he would always try and talk to our managers because they were men and the rest of us were women. When he would come in and our managers were gone he would be rude to the employees and complain. So there‚Äôs the background. 

Now, one night he comes in and I was alone helping two other customers, they were Asian and black, he places himself in front of them and basically acted like they weren‚Äôt there. I told him he would have to wait as I was helping them and he said ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter they‚Äôre darker skinned and used to waiting‚Äù. Honestly, I was so thrown off by his outright racism so all I said was please move and I‚Äôll be with you in a second. I helped the two customers and they moved to the side to look at their prints. Then the old guy comes up and hands me his flash drive. I asked him for the file name and how he wanted it printed. He called me stupid and that I should know these things. I told him that I didn‚Äôt appreciate the way he was talking to me. He continued to berate me for a little bit and then once I got a word in I told him that I would not be printing his things and he has to leave. This threw him over the edge because we were the only print shop around that was open that late and he needed his stuff printed by tomorrow morning. So I told him that if he would like my help he could go outside turn his attitude around and then once he got his head on straight and apologizes he can come back. Low and behold he leaves. I apologized to the earlier customers and they said if he makes a complaint they‚Äôd back me up on what happened. After they left he came back and said what‚Äôs your name I want to know your name I said ‚Äúmy name is lildragggg69 and my managers name is **** feel free to talk to him later. He tried handing me his flash drive and I said that I wanted an apology first, he became flustered again and started yelling at me for being a ‚Äúdisrespectful little girl‚Äù.

The second I quietly but firmly told him to stop he pulled the ""free country"" card because these types of people don't understand that that law doesn't apply to private businesses. He then called me a ""computer dictator"" because of this and even *other* customers had my back cause he just kept ranting like a crazy person. I don't think he left for another 10 minutes and I'm shocked the manager didn't just kick his ass out considering he was talking about how he hated America and wished it would blow up... as he is currently shopping in America, presumably because he can't get what supplies he needs in Cuba."

I offer to move her to a different room on another side of the hotel away from the noise source. She refuses, saying it was late. She demanded I come up with another solution. I tell her there isn't one. I can call the cops, but they wont do anything until at least midnight, probably later. I again tell her that we have other rooms in quieter area of the hotel, but she begins to shout that she doesn't want to move and just wants me to make them be quiet. This is when I flipped. I didnt yell at her, but i said something along the lines of ""ma'am, I have offered you the only solution I have to this problem, and you have refused it twice. At this point, I cant do anything to help you.""  She blew up and threatened to call our corporate office, and i told her she was welcome to do that, that i looked forward to speaking with them, and gave her my name.  Then I hung up on her. Not the most entertaining, but God damn was that frustrating."
r/askreddit,"I was a fragrance vendor at a large chain department store (think famous Christmas movies).

The thing about fragrance vendors is we actually work for the fragrance company and not for the store, so I didn‚Äôt report to anyone in that building or company I was working with.

It was Christmas time, probably around the 23rd when customers get desperate and crazy and where employees have been shit on every day since Black Friday so we just don‚Äôt care at all anymore.

I noticed a man waiting by the fragrance register though there was no store employee. I asked if I could help him and he said he had purchased a gift card at another register, but they hadn‚Äôt given him an envelope to put it in. I said, no problem let me check if we‚Äôve got any here (not technically my job, but I‚Äôm nice enough to do it). Lo and behold, we have 0 gift card envelopes.

ME: I‚Äôm very sorry sir, but it appears that we‚Äôre out at this register. Other registers might have some‚Äî

MAN: THIS IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS I BUY A GIFT CARD I SHOULD GET A FUCKING ENVELOPE TO PUT IT IN YOU PEOPLE ARE THE BIGGEST FUCKING IDIOTS IVE EVER MET‚Äî

ME: Sir, it‚Äôs the twenty-fucking-third of December. We are probably out of these envelopes everywhere. I don‚Äôt even work for [Big department store chain] so I don‚Äôt have to listen to you yell at me.

I walked off but I saw him deflate and shuffle off ashamed."
r/askreddit,"It wasn‚Äôt me but I was part of it. This customer was eating our buffet for a sport game of some sort. It had wings, pretzels, mozzarella sticks, etc. this huge man comes in and he get the buffet. Him and his date eat about 5/6 plates worth of food. The guy came up to me and said the food was not that good and he was not willing to pay the $30ish for the 2 buffets when it was no good. I then grabbed our manager (a total bada** he was awesome I could tell stories about him all day) and he told him off so hard explaining that he had so much food and didn‚Äôt complain when people checked on him etc. the guy was so baffled that we didn‚Äôt just straight up comp his meal he didn‚Äôt know what to say. If I remember correctly this guy was on a date with a fairly new woman too. Great early impression he must have made."
r/askreddit,"Not a cashier exactly, but a bartender. 

There was a hotel next to the restaurant/bar I worked at, which often would bring in crews of construction workers and other types of traveling workers. Most behaved themselves just fine, and some of my favorite regulars were seasonal workers who stayed next door. There were crass, classless individuals from time to time, though. Usually a quick comment that they‚Äôre in a restaurant, not a sports bar, was enough to calm them down, but not this group. They came in on a Friday, were loud, rude and vulgar, making passes at waitresses and irritating other guests. I ended my shift while they were still there, and when I arrived the next day, was informed that they followed a waitress out to her car, and wouldn‚Äôt let her leave. They blocked her from getting into her car, and when she finally was able to get past them, they stood in front of her car and jeered, making rude gestures and remarks. Eventually the kitchen guys came out, and they left. 

They showed back up the next night, and I was instructed to deal with them if they can back after the GM went home, which of course they did. So we started with the usual deal, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not welcome back due to your behavior, please leave‚Äù etc. The foreman (or whatever he was) insisted it was all a joke, and that I needed to get a sense of humor. His exact words were ‚ÄúYou need to go to the dollar store and buy a sense of humor‚Äù. Whatever that means. So this goes on for a bit, he actually had the gall to ask for a refund for the previous night. I declined, and as this conversation continued, I began to loose my patience. The guy got more belligerent, and insulting, and repeated his weird dollar store comment multiple times. I finally lost my patience roughly the 400th time he said this, and said ‚ÄúThe dollar store, huh? Is that where you get your dental work done? You have 10 seconds to get the hell out of this bar before I call the cops.‚Äù I could tell this was a sore spot for him, as he looks like he chewed rocks every day for breakfast. He deflated quickly, as several patrons and most of the waitstaff witnessing this laughed at him openly. 

He left quietly and did not come back."
r/askreddit,"I work in an anime store in the mall. One of the things we have is a wall of pop funkos. This guy brought up like 10 to the register and was just being ridiculously impatient the entire time. Our cash register is a little more than a calculator, so punching in each thing can take some time. Before I even hand him his receipt, he shouts at me saying ‚ÄúCAN I GET A FUCKING BAG?!?‚Äù, so I said we don‚Äôt have any. Watching him waddle out of the store with 10 pops stacked high made me feel better."
r/askreddit,"I worked in the tech shop at a CompUSA. A ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù came to the counter, was unhappy, and ended up spiting in my manager‚Äôs face. My normally calm ex Army Ranger manager reaches over the counter, grabbed the guy by the collar, and told him he has 10 seconds to leave the store or he will be leaving by ambulance! The general public is terrible!"
r/askreddit,Kicked a guy out of the store I was working at once. He insisted he paid with 2 20 dollars Bill's. His total was 17$ gave him the correct change and got a supervisor make him leave. It was honestly the dumbest scam I've ever seen anyone try to pull. Our cash was perfect that night not over at all.
r/askreddit,"I worked at a sandwich place for a year or so and had multiple bad experiences with customers, but this one takes the cake.

I was making this dude a hot chicken sandwich. I bring the sandwich up to the front and try to hand it to him. He just looks at me for a second then proceeds to scream and swear at me for spitting in his sandwich. I didn't spit in his food (kinda wish I did tho) and told him this over and over. The dude was yelling at me for probably 5 minutes. I was patient with him and gave him a new sandwich made by a different employee and totally refunded his order. But this dude decided that he wanted to be a dick so he hung around the store telling customers I was going to spit in their food and swearing a ton. I waited for my manager to step forward and kick the guy out but he was just pretending nothing was going on. Finally as I was making food for this family with really young kids, who were obviously uncomfortable with this dude's language, I freaking lost it. I slammed down the knife I was using, startling everyone because I had been so respectful to this guy for so long, and screamed ""We are a family friendly establishment so you can quit being an asshole and get the hell out of this store!"" For whatever reason that worked and he left cussing me out. I apologized to the family for the guy and for my swearing at him. I very nearly lost my job from that and got a long lecture from my boss about how the customer is always right and that I need to be respectful. Luckily my manager vouched for me, saying that I was extremely respectful until the guy started making other customers uncomfortable. I quit that job a few months later glad to be done with dumbass customers."
r/askreddit,"It was my last day of working in a common retail chain. 20 minutes before my shift ended, I was helping a middle aged woman do a return and exchange with coupons. She was getting agitated because our coupon policies are very strict and she was giving me attitude. I looked at her straight in the eye and took a deep sigh, ‚ÄúThis is my last day, I‚Äôm supposed to leave in 5 minutes‚Äù without smiling. She immediately became quiet and was way more cooperative."
r/askreddit,"It was a Sunday morning and he was in a rush, clearly in an irratitable mood. 

I greeted him nicely, as I do all the customers, rang his stuff up and then asked if he wanted to make a small purchase to support our philanthropic arm. He then proceedes to be rude, but I was not going to go there with him. 

So I told him ""God bless you, sir."" as he was grabbing his plastics before storming off."
r/askreddit,"Honestly? I never have. I don't take anything personally from customers. My co-workers have exploded on people, and to me it just seems childish and immature to do so. Especially over the silly shit they tend to explode over.

I don't subscribe to ""the customer is always right"" and I have shut people down when they get that way to me, but I don't do it by raising my voice or anything. I also don't give a shit about people threatening to tell my manager anything, even though I know for a fact that my managers would probably side with the customers because they are weak-willed fuckstains. I have pride in what I do, and I will not allow some entitled shit to wreck it."
r/askreddit,"When working at KFC, one summer the air con broke so it was unbearably hot. Towards the end of a busy day a regular awkward customer came up and asked us to turn the air con on. I turned to my co worked an said 'OMG they've solved it we need to put the air con on then it won't be so hot' my co-worker looked confused and said 'its broke' I turned back to the customer and said 'Oh yea I'm not an idiot the air cons broke and that's why it's not on'"

r/askreddit,"Yes, and I would just use Moe's queso and a lot of tortilla chips."
r/askreddit,"Easy - young Gouda since it has no too strong taste you get easily sick of. My strategy would be to eat half of in the first two days and drink as much as possible with it (assuming laxatives are cheating). I would also drink a lot of pineapple juice, since there are enzymes in there that help digest animal based protine. The last 5 days would be recovery and eating the other half."
r/askreddit,"I would try with goat's cheese, or maybe brie. I love that shit."
r/askreddit,Yes Brie cheese. I could easily down 5 lbs a day of that stuff with a French Baugette.
r/askreddit,"Yep, if I failed, I dislike cheese anyways. probably would cut it in 7 pieces and that piece must be finished at the most, end of the day."
r/askreddit,"Whipped cheese (like yoplait whips), technically cheese, as is fermented. SLURP IT UP!"
r/askreddit,"I'd ask for cream cheese, make a shit load of cheesecake for neighbors, make dips, make my eggs and mashed potatoes taste better, and put some on bagels.
It's a multipurpose cheese!"
r/askreddit,"Yeah, this would probably be pretty easy tbh"
r/askreddit,"I'd eat as much mozzarella as possible. Technically lactose intolerant but hey, it's cheese."
r/askreddit,"Yes, if I can choose the cheese, then I'd see if I could do a cottage cheese. If not allowed, then feta since those are some of the lowest calorie ones out there. I'd also do a lot of running and smoke a lot of weed throughout the week so I could have an appetite."
r/askreddit,"Yes, easily. You would have to eat a little over 4lbs a day, which is pretty manageable. Also you can choose the type of cheese. Brie is a pretty dense and heavy cheese. Cheddar and mozzarella you can eat plain or use on a wide range of other foods. Munster is my personal favorite cheese."
r/askreddit,I hate cheese so no loss for me. It would be mozerella tho.
r/askreddit,If I fail then I would probably not want to eat anymore cheese in my life anyways so I guess I will try it.
r/askreddit,"Depends what flavor, I usually like Gouda"
r/askreddit,Ill do it

r/askreddit,What kind of cheese? It totally depends on the type of cheese. Blue? Not a chance. Creamy red? Ill give it a go. Parmesan? Not a chance. A hard medium strenght cheese? Totally.
r/askreddit,Just make pizza
r/askreddit,So I have to cut my cheese intake for a week... sounds easy.
r/askreddit,I hate cheese.
r/askreddit,"I would try and probably fail, because I don't really like cheese. Win-win either way."
r/askreddit,"Mozzarella, I'd make mozzarella sticks and for 5 mil plus my rather strong lactose intolerance even losing wouldn't suck. #TeamWinWin"
r/askreddit,Tbh if you ate 30 pounds of cheese you'd never be able to eat it again anyway because it'd disgust you.
r/askreddit,I'll eat it for free
r/askreddit,"Guys, guys...I got this. Cottage cheese. 30 lbs in a week? Easy."
r/askreddit,mmm muenster cheese
r/askreddit,"That's like.... 4.3ish pounds of cheese a day. 

Man, even if that was all I could eat for a week I'd probably do it if I was guaranteed 5mil at the end. 

It's basically just one of those big blocks of cheese from the store per meal. 

I'd probably be sick at the end, but 5mil could go a long way towards fixing that.

Gimmie some sharp cheddar, I will have it with grapes and crackers and just eat cheese all day."
r/askreddit,"I'd go Matt Stonie on this.
I love parmesan or old gouda, but those are to Salty. For the challenge I'd take ethier young gouda, brie or mild gorgonzola!"
r/askreddit,Mozzarella and ye boi. Assuming there are no health problems
r/askreddit,"Well sure. I mean, I'll just choose a sharp cheddar wheel and enjoy it on like absolutely everything. After I'm done, I'll easily be able to afford the healthcare I'll need after eating 30lb of cheese."
r/askreddit,"Just grate the cheese wheel, make pizza using it so it's easier to eat, and then consume multiple pizzas per day.

the only downside to this is pooping will be difficult"
r/askreddit,"I‚Äôd do it, I already eat too much cheese already"
r/askreddit,"That breaks down to about 4.6 ounces of cheese an hour, 15 hours a day, for 7 days. I would choose fresh mozzarella as my cheese of choice, because it has a lot of moisture, and combine it with a steady diet of tomato, basil, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and laxatives."
r/askreddit,"Parmesan, aged 12 months"
r/askreddit,Nobody would succeed.
r/askreddit,"Hahahhahahaha of fucking course. Broccoli and cheddar soup, garlic bread with cheese, racalette, cheese sticks, nacho cheese you could just drink it!"
r/askreddit,wait people get paid for this stuff?
r/askreddit,"10000% would try, considering I'm lactose intolerant and   I'd either destroy my intestines and win $5mil or decide it's not worth it and just keep living like usual"
r/askreddit,"Hmmmm...about 4 lbs a day?  I could do that.  The constipation would be epic, though."
r/askreddit,Probably not. I can't fit a lot of food in my stomach at once so speed eating won't be a option and I'll probably fail.
r/askreddit,"Yes because I‚Äôm lactose intolerant. A week of sickness is worth 5 million. And if I fail, no biggie, I at least don‚Äôt ever have to raging diarrhea again"
r/askreddit,I'm from Wisconsin. I've been training for this scenario my entire life.

r/askreddit,"There's a Skyrim joke here, but I'm not clever enough to find it.

r/askreddit,"Depends on the cheese I guess? If it's just a giant block of cheddar or something, I could do that. Luckily it is over a week though. I could grab a pound at a time and eat it like a fucking candy bar while watching TV or playing a game or reading a book and barely notice it.

Plus I have enough constipation as it is due to IBS that it's not like I will get double constipated."
r/askreddit,"Yep. I'm already lactose intolerant so there's not really a downside, other than commiting gastrointestinal suicide for a week."

r/askreddit,"Yes. I binge eat all the time, 30lb of some cheese would be nothing. Then, once I win, I could use the money to buy more cheese."
r/askreddit,"Hell yeah! Lactose intolerance be damned! Sharp cheddar or mozzarella my way to 5 million bucks. No room for failure. If I fail, that means no more pizza and I gotta have my pizza."
r/askreddit,Cheese soup!
r/askreddit,If it's a vintage aged cheddar I could do it in like 3 days.
r/askreddit,"If it doesn't have to be solid, I can probably ear 30 pounds of Max and cheese in a week"
r/askreddit,"As long as it isn't going to kill me, then of course. I could quit work, buy a few houses, live off the rental income, etc. I could also just permanently vacation if I chose to, and I wouldn't miss cheese much after a while. If people can do it who are lactose intolerant, I should not have much trouble."
r/askreddit,"That's only a little more than four pounds of cheese a day, that's manageable. I'd choose something low fat so I don't get horrible diarrhea"
r/askreddit,"Who can eat 4.28 lbs. of cheese in one day, much less every day for 7 days?"
r/askreddit,"Wait you guys are getting paid to eat 30lbs of cheese in a week? Shit, I've been doing it for free this whole time..."
r/askreddit,I hate cheese so this is the perfect excuse to not eat cheese.
r/askreddit,That's just a dirty bulk
r/askreddit,I‚Äôd give it a shot. If I fail I will probably never want to eat cheese again anyway after trying to eat 30 lbs of the stuff.
r/askreddit,could i melt it and just slurp it down the shoot hole ?
r/askreddit,Pepper jack and yes plz gimme that
r/askreddit,"That‚Äôs 2.857oz per hour. Gimmie some nice parmaggiano reggiano and some Nebbiolo to wash it done, I‚Äôve got this."
r/askreddit,Yes. Mozzarella.
r/askreddit,30lbs of cottage cheese is just over 4.25 lbs a day. I'd fucking hate cottage cheese after the week but for $5 million I'd be willing to do a few things and hate them forever.

r/askreddit,I worked at a chain grocery store years ago. We had this awful smell down one particular isle. The manager never wanted to investigate and would just say something must have spilled. She even went as far to have us hang air fresheners on the shelves to mask the smell. Several years later the store underwent a remodel where isles were moved. They found a giant rats nest under the shelving unit of this particular isle. It was one of the most disgusting things ever. Once they cleaned it out the smell finally resolved.
r/askreddit,"I worked at a ""heath food grocery"" in Florida when I was in college.  About 90% of the money the store made was from supplements, not food.

No idea what was in it, but I sold at least 20 bottles per week."

I ask him about it and he starts talking about all the free shit he got from Coke, Pepsi, Nestle, all sorts of big companies. They would offer him free Falcons tickets, flights to resorts all over the place, etc.

Why? Because when they offered him this stuff he gave them more space on the shelves. Coke wants 5 feet more shelf space? Sure thing, just send me some tickets to see the Eagles next Saturday! 

He had a laundry list of shit that these companies gave him for better slot space. Even when companies started cracking down on it they‚Äôd just send gifts to his family."
r/askreddit,I work in retail bakery. We don‚Äôt make anything from scratch. Everything comes in frozen. We just bake it or thaw them out before putting them on the shelves. Cakes are premade we just put icing and decorations. Lots of customers don‚Äôt like that our products are kept in the freezer. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

r/askreddit,"We waste ALOT of food.  

Quality inspectors at grocery warehouses tear open bags, cut open fruits and veggies, and stick thermometers in meat and chicken.  That all gets thrown away.  

When meat products especially are above a certain temperature, they get discarded too.  I was once responsible for getting rid of over $100,000 worth of meat due to temperature.  

Made the warehouse discard $10,000 worth of strawberries that went moldy in the warehouse.  Didn't even get to the store."
r/askreddit,"A grocery store near me has a seafood scale which is wrong.  The salmon and catfish is weighed at 8 ounces but is well over a pound. 

Always check the weight of your meat using a separate scale and check the accuracy.  In this case it‚Äôs in our favor."
r/askreddit,The dudes in the meat department always have drugs
r/askreddit,"My first job was working at a grocery store. A few weeks before a planned ad launched, the stock team would reprice the items in the ads and mark them up, so the sales price was only a few cents less than the original, non-sale price. They‚Äôd do this in advanced and cycle through the store marking up items before they went on sale, then shortly after the sale went off, the prices would be lowered again. They had a specific night a week where the stock team would stay overnight to reprice everything."
r/askreddit,"Most big chain supermarkets have really shoddy buying practices.  The big one is for anything that is prone to spoilage, they'll leave it sit at the warehouse until it starts to rot then claim ""spoilage"" and negotiate for cheaper prices.  The growers have no choice but to accept the lower price and the store pays 16 year olds minimum wage to go through all of the produce and remove the rotten ones.

Rotten watermelons are fucking foul."
r/askreddit,"This is more of a dark secret of store waste but...

A good deal of grocery stores, not all, have to throw out bulk if you put it into the bags but don't buy it. Like if you scoop some gummy bears into a bag, for example, and get to the till and say you don't want it now, it gets thrown out because it could have been tampered with.

Same goes for fresh meat, if you walk out the front door, even if you immediately turn around and come back in and return it, we have to throw it out.

Also any form of ""Pharmacy"" product that is consumed (vitamins for example) or used for healing wounds, think neosporin and the like gets thrown out because it could be tampered with, if you return it. 

And just to make it clear I'm talking about stuff that is sealed on return, no store will put any of this back on the shelf if they are opened, well no non-shady store at least, lol."
r/askreddit,"If you ask an employee to check in the back for a product.  9 times out of 10 they just walk back there, wait a couple minutes, and walk back out to tell you they don‚Äôt have any more."
r/askreddit,"So this isn‚Äôt technically about the grocery store itself, but still relevant. 

My first ever job was as a bagger in a grocery story when I was 15. To work in this store, however, I HAD to be part of the union in order to work there. Working in said union included a monthly fee as my union dues. 

After 6 months, they started cutting my hours more and more each week, until finally, they cut my hours completely for 4 months. After that time, I got a bill in the mail for $150 of unpaid union dues. I called the office and tried to reason with them, saying that I was a 15 year old high school student and this was my only income. They responded and said that it didn‚Äôt matter and I still had to pay the dues. 

I asked if they would pursue the bill if I quit, and they said no. I called the grocery store the next day and quit, without notice.

EDIT: also, one of my responsibilities was to help people to their car and load groceries in their car if they wanted. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to accept tips. One time, around Christmas this guy bought $700 worth of grocery and helped load them into his car. He came back and tried to give me a $50 tip in front of my manager and walked away after I said I couldn‚Äôt accept it. Manager took it since I‚Äôm not allowed to accept tips. She acted like she was going to put it in the register, but she pocketed it."
r/askreddit,"I worked for a Sam‚Äôs club and the only bothersome thing I noticed other than their stingy payroll was the amount of food being thrown away. They PRAISED themselves on donating to the local food bank, but its only like 1-2% of what actually gets thrown away. 

I worked the grocery part and had to do the reclaims sometimes and hated myself throwing away ALOT of good food..only because the package was torn or smashed a little. They didn‚Äôt care because I guess they got reimbursed some of that money back. And even worse, they wouldn‚Äôt even let it slide if we wanted something that was gonna get thrown away anyway. They would threaten to write us up if we were to grab a hot pocket out of a ripped box for example."
r/askreddit,"I have worked in grocery stores for about 18 years. With 10 of them being in management. There are too many to list so I will give a couple. I would say 95 - 98% of customer complaints just get ignored. Almost everytime someone will give you your money back just so you comeback and spend more money. When you say you will never come back. We dont believe you.

Most grocery stores have a net profit of about 2-3%. The really good ones can get up around 10%(although rare). Just think about that. There is a reason you dont see enough registers open when you shop. Labor is the #1 controllable expense. I personally never use self check because they are taking a job from another person. Plus they breakdown easily and I have had to fix them too many times.

There is a reason why things are in specific places in most stores. Like fresh produce right when you walk in, or dairy all the way in the back corner of the store. Ever wonder why sugary kids cereals are on the bottom shelves? Its so kids see them. 

There are so many tricks grocery stores use to get you to buy more items. This isnt even the tip of the iceberg."
r/askreddit,"There's a grocery store near where I live and a lot of students shop there.

Anyway, not only do the carts hold everybody‚Äôs food and get touched by stranger‚Äôs hands all day, they get trash left in them. All the time. If the store gives out samples, 90% of the time they leave the napkin and leftovers in the cart. We take the trash out, but we don‚Äôt clean them, thats why a lot of chains leave out sani-wipes by the door.

That and nobody actually gives a damn about your complaint. They pretend to care to get you out of the store. Once you leave, it‚Äôs considered problem solved."

r/askreddit,"I have a friend who used to work for China's largest agricultural conglomerate, which makes it one of the largest in the world.  They started out mainly specializing in rice but also do a ton of cooking oil and some other common products in China.  He climbed the ranks until he was in charge of distribution for Chongqing, one of the largest cities in the world.  His job, basically, boiled down to figuring out how to bribe grocery store chain owners to putting his company's products in prime shelving space, and figuring out how to bribe local factories and farming conglomerates to lower their prices for his company relative to the competition.  This mainly consisted in metric fuck tons of KTV whores, baijiu (Chinese hard liquor), tobacco, drugs, especially Ketamine in his time, and assisting with money laundering schemes (mainly real estate and stock market trickery).  He had 16 hour days, 6-7 days a week of nothing but drinking, whoring, drug dealing, embezzlement, and endless ass kissing and getting his own ass kissed.

He burned out of that in less than 2 years once he finally reached the position he had worked his ass off 8 years to get.  The grocery business, like all businesses at the top levels in China (and probably most other countries as well if we're being honest) is extremely morally grey and exhausting.

EDIT--I will say that since Xi started cracking down on some of the outward corruption, this kind of stuff is more on the DL than before.  People have to be more clever and subtle and discrete but I highly doubt things are really different below the surface.  My friend got out of that business half a decade ago now though so I don't have an insider view any more."

Lot of them had great points about why that wouldn't work or why our wouldn't do anything for them."
r/askreddit,"I'm pro-vaccine of course, but I'm wary of giving the government excessive control over parenting decisions, and giving them more avenues to force drugs on people. 

The MMR vaccine is extremely well established, and has a long track record. Everyone should get it. But there is no limitation here to established, proven safe vaccines. There would be nothing to prevent a future vaccine requirement, of far more debatable vaccines, and that I would have a problem with. Likewise, the disease being vaccinated against matters; should we encourage kids to get an HPV vaccine? Sure, but it isn't the same sort of public health issue that justifies requiring everyone to get an MMR vaccine."
r/askreddit,"That would absolutely be overstepping by the government.  Should we then charge parents who provide terrible diets to their children and promote sedentary lifestyles as it's leading to massive increases in childhood diabetes and a litany of other health problems?  If we are extending the claim to the importance of heard immunity and the danger to non-vaccinationed children, then we need to start similarly charging people who go out in public with colds and flus as that is DIRECTLY exposing dangers to society.  Is it reckless and irresponsible by the parents?  Without question.  HOWEVER, everything doesn't need a law just because you disagree with the actions of others."
r/askreddit,"Eww no. Until they start fining people for spreading colds, flu, stomach bugs, RSV, hand and foot disease and any other contagion that is potentially fatal, the relatively few diseases that are prevented from vaccines should not be the top priority to the point of sending otherwise good parents(selfish and uniformed) to jail. We don't have enough foster parents to handle that weight and the psychological effects of being removed from their parents should overshadow them potentially getting a preventable disease, the mental health of the children should be top priority for most people, but obviously no one is thinking about all of the ramifications of this idea, or they're too brainwashed, not sure which. No, one should be forced to put anything potentially harmful into their body or child's body. In the US, we have informed consent, we have to sign for vaccines for this reason.

Very scary so many think they should have a right to another's body to benefit society. Fucking gross."
r/askreddit,"Badly. Picture this scenario:

You are pro-vax but don't trust the Government. A new vaccine comes out that you heard didn't get proper testing. Normally you go get vaccines on your own but this one you think you're going to wait on. All of a sudden, 3 armed officers in riot gear show up at your door, smash it down, grab you and throw you in a police van, separating you from your child. Then they, acting on behalf of the government, forcefully inject you with a foreign substance, and inform you that you will be sent to jail. 

Who is the bad guy here?"
r/askreddit,"Take children with parents who may care for them very much despite one glaring flaw, and tear them away, forcing the children into Forster care? I'm saying this as somebody who is pro-vaccine with an anti-vax mother, children are WAY better off with anti-vax parents then with no parents.

The cases that make the news all the time of horrible child abuse are cases where the parents are not just anti-vax, but anti modern medicine. Those cases where children catch an easily preventable disease and then receive no medical care are the ones where the children's lives are at risk, and should be dealt with appropriately.

The solution to the anti-vax problem, along with many other problems we have as a society, is proper education on the issues. Locking people up is only going to tear families apart and put children in potentially worse situations than they started out. I'm not saying nothing should be done to encourage parents to vaccinate their children of course. Preventing children from enrolling in public schools or attending daycares, while terrible for those children, is a necessity to protect other children from diseases they cannot be immumized to and diseases where vaccinations are not 100% effective."
r/askreddit,Too many laws already - if we want people to change more education and information needs to be wide spread
r/askreddit,Oh yeah I wonder how Reddit feels about this. Fucking piss off.
r/askreddit,"It still wouldn't fix stupid, and it would just create more backlash from that misinformed side. Often, just passing a law that bans something doesn't fix a problem as well as people want it to."
r/askreddit,Come on. You know exactly what the Reddit community thinks about this issue.
r/askreddit,I'm not a fan of the jailtime option. There are enough kids in the foster care system right now.
r/askreddit,"I don‚Äôt think there should be a punishment, just take the kids for a bit, and make sure it‚Äôs safe for them to be vaccinated, vaccinate them, and return them."
r/askreddit,"We have to remember body autonomy. I‚Äôm very for vaccines. As an adult I get boosters to stay safe and work in health care. But I also believe people have the right to make medical choices about their body. Forces vaccines in my mind is just as wrong as not allowing women abortions. The problem is parents are making choices for their children because they are minors and quite frankly not really able to comprehend the situation. And let‚Äôs be honest, I don‚Äôt know a single kid who would willingly get a shot. 

So I think a part of the solution would be to have parents who refuse vaccinations go through a re-education. They should also be required to hold additional insurance just Incase their kid gets sick with a preventable disease, and shares it with other kids. I think we could prevent a lot of non vaccinated kids if it costs parents extra money. Of course, kids who can get a vaccine because of legit medical reasons would not be held to this extra insurance. I also believe parents should be held responsible legally if their kid does get a disease that could have been prevented from vaccines. I also believe kids who are older (think teenagers) who want to get vaccinated should be able to without parental consent. I strongly believe programs should be put in place for these kids to get vaccinations at school. A lot of kids of anti-vax parents grow up and realize how stupid their parents are and want to be vaccinated. They just don‚Äôt have access. If the government had a program where they went to high schools a few times a year and provided vaccine education (including the real dangers of vaccines) and students who were not vaccinated wanted to get vaccinated they could. Of course we would have to change some laws to give children more rights over their bodies to make this a reality."
r/askreddit,"I would be far more supportive of a law that makes sure anti-vaxxers pay the healthcare of their own kids and that of the people their unvaccinated children infect. Recently in Oregon a child had a tetanus and the cost of his care is nearly $1M. His parents have still not vaccinated him. And that‚Äôs not even talking about the measles in Vancouver Washington. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna981256"
r/askreddit,"This is wrong. I think vaccination should be legally forced but antivaxxing is by no means assault. Negligence is debatable but I would argue that it requires a more specific *mens rea*. 

It should be a misdemeanor, and there should be a serious fine."

r/askreddit,"I don't think jail time would be good at all because I think putting people in jail for non-violent offenses is stupid, pointless and a huge waste of resources. Plus that would be traumatizing for their children. But charging them with child negligence if their child doesn't have some medical condition that bars them from being able to get vaccines? Fuck yes. You are neglecting your child's medical needs and putting the general public in danger."
r/askreddit,"This law would be both good and bad one the one hand more people would probably be vaccinated, on the other hand this would most likely lead to rebellious behaviour from some citizens who don't agree with it."
r/askreddit,Great
r/askreddit,"That wouldn't really work. 
Also, what would happen to kids when their parents stay in jail? Will they get vaccinated while mom and dad are in jail?

In my country vaccines are mandatory. And if you want to enroll your kid in school you need to present an official paper that says that your kid has all the required vaccines (lately they have added CBC test in the paper)

Everything has been ok until this week where an unvaccinated foreign from Europe came here for a vacation and started to show symptoms of measles.
So, airports are going to be more careful with unvaccinated people."
r/askreddit,"Nah, the situation can be remedied by vaccinating their kids. At worst they should have a vaccine probation officer assigned to make sure mandatory vaccinations aren‚Äôt missed. What they are doing can hurt their kids but the remedy is easier than burdening the foster care and adoption system."
r/askreddit,"Assault

#Assault


Calm the fuck down man"
r/askreddit,"Perfect! Though maybe not jail time, but a fine would be great!"
r/askreddit,"The libertarian in me says no. People are allowed to not take vaccinations like they should be allowed to get an abortion. Now if a community says no unvaccinated kids are allowed in the neighborhood, or a school says you are not allowed to enroll. I'm good with that."
r/askreddit,Not assault. Just neglect and a public health violation.
r/askreddit,"I think it‚Äôs dangerous to have a precedent of mandatory medical procedures, but it‚Äôs also dangerous to have unvaccinated people. Not sure."
r/askreddit,There was a measles outbreak near my area. But that doesn't sound like a good idea.
r/askreddit,"Cool, where do I okay this on the ballot?"
r/askreddit,Maybe not assault but definitely child negligence
r/askreddit,"""Only a Sith deals in absolutes"", are you the type that would insist on those that are under a doctor's orders not to vaccinate to be vaccinated?  Or can you see the color gray?"
r/askreddit,GET ER BUD
r/askreddit,"Well that would certainly solidify their anti-vaxx stance even more.  They will feel attacked and will rebel and fortify.  You cannot unconvinced them like that.  

Also, making ‚Äúyour child is dead‚Äù jokes isn‚Äôt helping at all.  There are plenty of non vaccinated children that aren‚Äôt dead. When every retort is some humorous variant of ‚Äúvaccinate or your child dies‚Äù and the child doesn‚Äôt die, it is taken as proof that the pro-vaccine crowd must be wrong.   So next time you feel like recycling the ‚Äútiny coffin‚Äù joke from House, Provide a link to herd immunity instead."
r/askreddit,"I have thought if this before, as I believe this is a ""For the greater good"", if nothing else. I seen it as a positive thing, but there would need to be exemptions. Such as allergies, or something else I can't foresee at the moment. It shouldn't be seen as just child neglect, it should be seen as an act of ""willful endangerment of a child"" and ""willful act of harm to others"", and possibly ""Willful harbouring of dangerous virus / disease"". It could be a loss of health coverage with cost of any infected people's healthcare, with a large increase of property tax, and or loss of citizenship/benefits. (I am from Canada). 

I don't care about who you are, or where you come from, preheat your beleife system is. But if you wanna not vax your kid, you should get out of Canada, or lose all Canadian benefits."
r/askreddit,It‚Äôs a good thing for human
r/askreddit,I think there should just be a law that makes parents vaccinate their kids
r/askreddit,Charge them with child negligence and fine them heavily. Really heavily.
r/askreddit,"I'm mixed, honestly I think instead of charging them with a crime just deny them access to public school. However if the child has a autoimmune disorder like AIDS they should be allowed but marked for safety reasons like a diabetic bracelet. 

Same time I think antivaxxers are that stupid maybe it takes a plague to end it."
r/askreddit,Fuck Off
r/askreddit,Ye
r/askreddit,Just fine the crap out of them and refuse access to public things.
r/askreddit,"negligence/child endangerment  yes... tho not so sure about assault with jail time.

The children are not able to make this decision for themselves' so in many similar situations the ""state"" must step in to protect the welfare of the innocent children. However an adult should free to be as stupid and self endangering as he/she wants to be.."
r/askreddit,"While one could argue that this would give the government too much control, there's a point where you don't get to endanger another life and force your will on them.  However, I feel jail time is too extreme.  Kids still love their parents and they probably wouldn't want their parents thrown in prison over vaccinations.  I think that threatening to take away the kid would be enough for some parents to vaccinate.  And if they still won't budge then take the kid."
r/askreddit,"Im pretty sure cps can take ur kid away if u dont vaxx them 

I heard that was a thing in america"
r/askreddit,I believe that anti-vaxxers should be charged with child neglect but assault charges are too far. They don't deserve that. But child neglect charges are a good idea in my opinion.
r/askreddit,"Set up a firing squad with dart guns filled with vaccine

But don‚Äôt tell them it‚Äôs a dart gun"
r/askreddit,I am pro-vaxx but I don't believe anti-vax counts as assault or that jail time would help. That would lead to the break-up of a lot of families unnecessarily.
r/askreddit,"Terrible Idea! Never give the government that kind of power. You've gotta remember that it's just a large group of imperfect individuals, just as corrupt and irresponsible as the rest of us."
r/askreddit,Can the same law apply to dance-moms and pageant parents?
r/askreddit,"I think that jail is just too much

but anti-vaxxers suck

a little needle, just a touch

the Karens go amok

&amp;#x200B;

Now poor young timmy missed a shot

and diseases spread

Polio's what Timmy got

and now Timmy is dead"
r/askreddit,Kidnapping and rape hardly seem like good answers to a person‚Äôs right to self ownership.
r/askreddit,"I would be against this law, however I would be in favor of punishing parents whose failure to vaccinate results in a provable link between their child, and another child who was medically unable to get vaccinated.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you choose to roll those dice, and someone else dies because of your actions, you are able to be tried as a conspirator to commit involuntary manslaughter.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a similar charge that can be levied against a person who knows you get into a vehicle while being intoxicated / too drunk to drive and you kill someone.  ([http://restaurantescala.com/2016/05/13/can-you-be-held-criminally-liable-for-letting-someone-drive-drunk/](http://restaurantescala.com/2016/05/13/can-you-be-held-criminally-liable-for-letting-someone-drive-drunk/))

&amp;#x200B;

in my mind, its the same thing. You knowingly avoided committing actions that society as a whole will suffer for. If any negative outcome occurs due to your intentional actions, then you are civilly and criminally liable for those outcomes."
r/askreddit,You know exactly how reddit feels about this lmao
r/askreddit,Not jail time but definitely forced to vaccinate. I strongly encourage vaccines.
r/askreddit,I'm pro vaxx but forcing people to get vaccines causes ethical and legal issues and the increased amount of people being given vaccines will mean more licensed people are needed which may not be good as a large influx of supply in workers will lead to weaker training and could result in mistakes. On of my teachers got a vaccine applied incorrectly and now he is paralysed from the waist down. I do believe all people should get vaccines but they should do so through their own choice and be informed of why they should vaccinate.
r/askreddit,Splendid.
r/askreddit,that would be music in my ears
r/askreddit,Assault? In what possible way?
r/askreddit,Best law
r/askreddit,"I'm in favour of an escalating scale of intervention:

&amp;#x200B;

If the children have already been vaccinated and it's just a belief, then it's fine to take no actions (not withstanding the potential of false information but that is out of the scope of neglect here.)

&amp;#x200B;

If it's decided that an anti-vaccination sentiment is putting children at risk, then the caregivers of those children should be educated, just like you would be for reckless driving.

&amp;#x200B;

Whoever makes decisions about neglect would also be able to make that distinction (it should be part of the investigation to ask the parents about vaccinations and other health-care issues for their children.)

&amp;#x200B;

And then if that education is rejected, or nothing continues to change, then yes, a formal charge of neglect (however it is defined locally) should be brought. That could include jail time, but more likely further education and community service.

&amp;#x200B;

Ironically, not all relationships between children and anti-vax parents are unhealthy in every respect. The best outcome would be to empower the parents to make informed, healthy decisions. We should dial it back from that ideal as we encounter insurmountable obstacles to appropriate parenting."
r/askreddit,No. Just force them to vaccinate unless there is an actual medical reason. I also think religion should not be a reason to not vaccinate. That's just my opinion though
r/askreddit,If they end up spreading the disease they could be.
r/askreddit,I think they should just charge them a hefty fine and make it illegal to not vaccinate their kids
r/askreddit,"Chosing to be anti-vaxx is a personal choice, even if it‚Äôs a very bad/unethical choice. In my opinion, laws shouldnt take away that choice but instead prohibit/restrict the amount of unvaccinated people from public facilities where their presence could cause a profound threat to herd immunity. 

ex: schools (especially elementary schools and preschools where there are lots of young kids with weak immune systems), daycares, or certain parts of hospitals (ICU and NICU). to name a few"
r/askreddit,"Yeah, don't punish. Incentivize. Make vaccinations covered by gov funds and require them for public schools."
r/askreddit,Most anti-vaxxers have been brainwashed into thinking that way. Want to get at the heart of the problem? Jail the people who produce the propaganda and endanger public safety
r/askreddit,"Education would be a better solution, in my opinion."
r/askreddit,Ah yes. The ole ‚Äúdear Reddit‚Äù polling apparatus...
r/askreddit,"Charge them money. Jail isn‚Äôt needed. If you want something done, hurt their wallets"
r/askreddit,"I don't know if I would voluntarily support it, but a this point, it's borderline necessary."
r/askreddit,Happy.
r/askreddit,"I think it'd be good, but as well as being sent to jail, they have to go through an education process where they learn from real doctors with a medical degree related to the field of vaccines, and cannot leave until they have completed their sentence AND the doctors believe they have truly learned. Then, when they are released on probation, one of the things they MUST do is vaccinate themselves and their children if they still have any. And by the way, I'm talking about all the prisons based on reformation and education rather than punishment."
r/askreddit,"Yes, but only if their child dies or gets disfigured for life from catching a preventable disease, or a court can prove that someone else caught a preventable disease from their child and died or got permanently disfigured from it. I don't know if assault would be the right crime though. I feel like they should also get charged with some form of bioterrorism in the case of their unvaccinated children passing on diseases to someone else."
r/askreddit,"I think it's an idea so absurd and disconnected from reality that it will never come to pass in free countries such as the USA.         

I'm not going to vaccinate myself or kids in the hopes of starting a pandemic that will wipe out all these basement dwelling redditors, shills and astroturfers so I don't have to scroll past all this inane vaccine hysteria day after day."
r/askreddit,Demoneytising those that spread this nonsense would help greatly. Punishing ignorant and weak minded is not a solution.
r/askreddit,"In theory i would find it a good solution. But the fact is, making things punishable just leads to people trying to work around the problem, for instance here in Australia they made some laws to penalize parents who don't vaccinate the kids before they enroll them in a school. Their solution? Just start homeschooling. I sort of think making these things illegal just pushes more of those people to try and stand against it. I hate these fuckwits as much as the next person, but i don't think jail will be very effective."

r/askreddit,It woud be noice
r/askreddit,"In Germany, there is a law being discussed at the moment, that would require any child to be vaccinated, if it is going to attend kindergarden. The anti-vaxxer problem here is a lot less prevalent, than it is in the US, but the government still does not give a shit about stupid believes based on no facts at all and does not accept risking immuno-compromised childring dieing as a result - and that is at least one thing to be proud of as a German."
r/askreddit,I support this.
r/askreddit,Oh how controversial. Get the fuck outta here with this BS post.

r/askreddit,"I had a couple of them in my prodomme days who were just great and occasionally I still talk to them even though I'm retired. 

My actual nicest client was this super-sweet blue-collar dude (I know the stereotype about powerful businessmen and all that but honestly as someone who was more of a midrange provider, like 90% of my clients were working- and middle-class guys who did manual labor for a living) who basically used spending time with me as his Treat Yo Self moment -- like, he was a single dad of several kids who had to work WAY too much and just had no time or energy to date, let alone find someone who was into his particular fetishes, and that's a role I fulfilled for a lot of people. If he finished a big project, or nailed a job interview, or got promoted or whatever, I was one of the first people he'd contact. Instead of taking himself out to a nice dinner or something like that, he'd book a few hours with me. 

So basically, if he texted me, it immediately made my day because it meant something good had happened to him, and nearly every time I saw him, he was in a great mood. (One time he tried to book me *before* a big life event that he was super anxious about, and I ended up just straight-up not letting him pay me that time because it just felt like he really needed to be with somebody to hang out and talk. We spent most of the session just getting stoned and watching baseball. He still tipped me anyway.) 

He was always really polite and kind, never pushy, never made me feel unsafe, really great and straightforward communicator, wasn't afraid to ask questions if he didn't know what to do. 

And I know this is silly, but the kicker was: he'd often come see me directly from his construction job, and he would always (I never once asked him to do this) shower, brush his teeth, etc. and change into a buttondown shirt and dress pants, ironed and sharp AF, before or right when he arrived. Even though he knew he was probably going to be naked in 10 minutes, he still wanted to look nice when he actually came into my space as a show of respect, and I dunno, I just thought that was really sweet. 

I know I was lucky and privileged in many respects, but I really did like my clients a lot.

Edit: a grammar"
r/askreddit,"This reminds me of one story that I saw in an other subreddit. It was written by the Escort in went something like this:

She was ordered by an middle aged man and the only request he made was that she would come hungry. She thought that guy would be into feeding or something along the lines.

When she arrived he just let her sit at an table and started to cook. They ate their meal and chatted, nothing else. 
He later told her that he loved to cook and always did cook for his wife.
The thing was that his wife had passed and he didn‚Äòt want to cook just for himself."
r/askreddit,"Quite honestly, I never saw anyone who wasn‚Äôt super sweet. However, one does stand out in my mind. He was a middle-aged STEM guy who had the cutest little house which was absolutely overflowing with rare books. Literally, his whole house was a library.

He was my favorite for so many reasons. We never had dull conversations and I really looked forward to time spent with him.

He would never settle for anything less than the best food/cocktails when we went out and he was an excellent chef himself so that was pretty great.

The gifts he gave me were super personalized. I don‚Äôt think anyone in my life ever gave me such intimate, thoughtful gifts. I had a lot of guys give me the typical clothes/shoes/makeup that were lovely gifts nonetheless, but this guy once gave me a Bosco Olympic tracksuit because I mentioned I liked Adidias once. It‚Äôs my favorite material possession lol."
r/askreddit,"*\*obligatory not me but...\**

Met an escort in the ladies room of a fancy event. 

I was having a serious wardrobe malfunction, I was nervous as hell to be there, and was 17 anyway so felt very out of place. I was crying and freaking out cause my dress was broken and me crying was ruining my makeup (which I didn't know how to fix) and I was going to have to go up on stage in like 15 minutes. 

Everyone was ignoring me but a lovely escort came over, helped me fix my dress and makeup (an taught me a couple of tricks), and really calmed me down. She took me back to my table and snuck me a flute of champagne. 

One of the nicest, and most charming women I've ever met and was definitely my saviour that day!"
r/askreddit,"My friend is an escort. She had this regular that had lost his wife years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

He would book her for 2-3 hours every Sunday, just to talk. He never did anything with her."
r/askreddit,"Many years ago, I decided, as a single British/Irish male that I could find a niche doing home visits to ladies. At that time, we had an advert for chocolates, where a gent' dressed in black would do some 007 type thing, just to leave a box of these chocolates on her bed. He would leave his card, then absail away!
    Anyway, I don't absail, but I did start 'home visits'... I put out an advert and went from there... I would arrive with the groceries to make the lady a meal of her choice, with the wine of her choice, then do my utmost to please her... Then I would (after being paid) do the dishes and leave, without much of a trace I'd ever been there.
    I saw one lady more than any of the others. She told me one evening that she loved me.. The sad bit is that I didn't feel the same. - But that was the greatest compliment I have ever had 
    I stopped doing this on that very evening. - Doing what I did, one of my clients falling in love with me had never been a factor when I first thought of the general idea.
    The lady is fine and happy. She later married a lovely chap. I even got an invite to the wedding, so I guess she told him. I wouldn't go. It was not right. Regards. S."
r/askreddit,I did not expect a thread about professional escorts to give me a big smile but this one did. Thanks to everyone answering. such great stories!
r/askreddit,"My nicest customer was a French rich entrepreneur who took me on a holiday to Miami.
I got paid 3k$ per day that I traveled with him and he paid my travel expenses coming down to 10k$ or so. And I got for 5k$ in presents during that short holiday.
We stayed 1 week. 
And the sex was amazing. He had a six pack and a very well toned body. 
He didn‚Äôt mind that I‚Äôm a trans girl. He just thought I was cute.
We still have contact and he comes for a session every 3 months.
He always brings me a necklace from Von Cleef And Arpels when he comes to visit me."
r/askreddit,"The first time I had met him was in London. He had payed for me to be with him for a week while he was at a business meeting. This week was one of the best weeks I‚Äôve ever spent with a person. He was so intelligent and kindhearted. He was full of stories and there wasn‚Äôt ever a dull moment. By the end of the trip, he had asked if I wanted to go on another trip, to pick the destination and we would go. 
From the time I got to the airport to our next trip, we would text from morning till night. We couldn‚Äôt stop talking about books we had read and tons of stories of our lives. When I was on the flight, I was counting down the minutes till I could see him. Somehow during the trip, he had asked me something about my childhood and it brought up how I was accepted into Harvard but I was unable to pay for it. I was given a few scholarships but not enough for it to be worth it. We had finished our trip and went home. 
A few weeks after the trip, still texting, he had said he would pay for me to go to Harvard. I thought he was being sarcastic, it took him awhile to convince me he wasn‚Äôt joking and I just started balling my eyes out. I have never received a gift that meant so much to me. I was going to be able to go to my dream school.
I started school shortly after but it wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting. I didn‚Äôt make a lot of friends. I didn‚Äôt want anyone to know my past, so I always kept to myself. I missed my friends and I missed him. 
I started to develop feelings for him and the next time we met he proposed. 
We‚Äôre married now and expecting our first child. 
I know I left out a lot of details but he is currently next to me and we are going to watch game of thrones."

Also big pharma is fucked rn"

Conservatives once had a good grounding effect when it came to fiscal matters."
r/askreddit,"Conservatism is good if you truly are conservative. In the sense that you don‚Äôt believe in over inflated budgets, or over reaching laws, or the idea that individual states should run themselves. But in reality I see very little conservatives who are like this."
r/askreddit,"As someone who leans liberal, we need conservatives in this country as well.  We balance each other.  Liberals push us forwards and address new problems while conservatives keep us from going off the rails and provide a stable foundation.  Or at least that's how it should be.  We somehow lost all ability to work together.

I don't want us to reach either extreme.  Too far left, throwing new ideas at a wall like spaghetti, and you end up with Mao's China.  People starving because of government programs given no thought.  Nobody was there to curb the excess.  To far right and you end up with Afghanistan under the Taliban.  No progress, only regression and suffering.  We need each other and working together has been the key for success."
r/askreddit,Neither of them is [mutually exclusive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_liberalism).
r/askreddit,I consider myself a conservative but in this political climate many people think I‚Äôm a liberal. Somewhere in the last generation the right really lost their way. They are no longer fiscally conservative and their politics are just cruel. Hopefully we get back to where we used to be because we are pushing liberals even farther left because of it. Something needs to be done because this country is extremely divided right now.
r/askreddit,"I absolutely agree that the 2nd amendment is important, and that overrestricting gun access is a bad thing. I can also understand wanting more secure borders TO AN EXTENT.

r/askreddit,"Liberalism is not an 100% conservatism opposite, and as a liberal I feel much more closer to conservatism (economics, foreign policy) rather than social democrats. Many European liberals, including me, identify themselves as centre-right ones.

r/askreddit,"As an ideal conservatism is about curbing excess; Excessive spending, excessive regulation, excessive governmental power to interfere with the private citizen. All of those things in excess cause problems: Debt, businesses unable to function well or at all under layers of red tape, the denial of civil liberties.

Liberalism as an ideal is about changing the current status quo to right the wrongs. Most popular recent battle has been the battle the battle for gay marriage.

The devil, as always, is in the details. In the past (and still are?) conservatives were beholden to the religious and were seeking to enforce religious morality on the populace at large. Now a days liberals are beholden to the identitarians currently trying to rip the nation in two and engaging in racism, sexism, bigotry, hatred, and seperationism in the name of ending racism, sexism, bigotry and hatred.

And of course both sides are filled with your typical politicians and corruption."
r/askreddit,"At their best, both sides are capable of ensuring people aren‚Äôt overlooked or forgotten during major changes in society."
r/askreddit,"Ok, the idea of conservatism, to me, isn't that bad.  The application and reach of its philosophy is.  From a financial stand point, spending money we don't have can have consequences down the road.  Minimizing pork in budgets is important.  The tax system needs an overhaul, perhaps to Eisenhower era levels.  Offer tax incentives for reinvestment into a company, improvements to labor's conditions and wages, and job additions.  If the money is just going to go to stock buy backs or corporate bonuses, tax the shit out of it.  If they choose to leave, that's fine, throw them a massive tariff.  No company should make billions, treat its employees with the same level of care and safety as slaves, and pay no taxes.  Their want to shield the rich and back religious zealotry is a lot of why I can never vote conservative."

r/askreddit,"As a liberal, I'm still in favor of fiscal responsibility and a minimum national debt. I also am not in favor of stricter gun controls. And while the idea of a wall is just stupid, eventually the porous border could become a problem if a terrorist wanted to sneak in a nuke.

r/askreddit,"Conservatism is good because liberals interfering in the market usually fucks things up.

See rent control. Sounds good but in reality landlords will say fuck it, if you're capping my income I'm not going to bother keeping up my establishment.

EDIT: [Here you go:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_regulation#2017_study_of_the_San_Francisco_housing_market)

""They found that while San Francisco's rent control laws benefited tenants who had rent controlled units, it also resulted in landlords removing 30% of the units in the study from the rental market, (by conversion to condos or TICs) which led to a 15% citywide decrease in total rental units, and a 7% increase in citywide rents."""

r/askreddit,"Liberal here.

The parts of conservatism I like really boil down to personal responsibility and hard work.  Like, don't spend more than you take in and work hard to make sometihng of yourself.  I believe in balanced budgets even if it means having to trim programs and governments just working like the rest of us.

What I don't like are the social parts of it and, honestly, just the need to ""offend them libtards"" when in reality I'm honestly more ""politically incorrect"" than most conservatives I have met as long as its funny."

r/askreddit,"Conservatists have a very valid point in the need of preserving traditions. It slows globalisation.

Globalisation is in my opinion overall positive phenomenon, but has its serious downsides, and (like everything) can be dangerous if led to the extremes, therefore should be embraced but with caution. 

Another good point they have is that we should not review our law system too rapidly. Law of course needs to be updated , but I agree that it should be **evolution** and never **revolution**."
r/askreddit,"I'm al conservative who believes in the tenets laid out by the father of conservatism, Edmund Burke.  Since my belief system is based on political philosophy and not radical Manichaeism and bumper stickers I'm somewhat without a party these days (and in the context of the modern GOP, basically a liberal, but at this point Reagan and Goldwater would be too, so I'm in good company), so I might be able to answer for both sides.

Conservatism arose out of a reaction to the French revolution. In the early heady days before the guillotining started, Edmund Burke was asked to send his congratulations to the revolutionary committees in France. He instead adopted a ""wait and see"" attitude, because, 

&gt; I must be tolerably sure, before I venture publicly to congratulate men upon a blessing, that they have really received one.

The rest, the Terror, the rise of Napoleon, is history.

And that is actual conservatism.  The belief that, the status quo should only be changed slowly, because there are always unintended consequences with change.  And the best way to prevent those unintended consequences from spiraling out of control is with slow, thoughtful, deliberate change.

The left was always a natural and necessary counterbalance.  To conservatives, change is anathema. They're just not optimists when it comes to human nature.  But again to quote Burke,

&gt; A state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation.

The left and the right should exist as natural counterbalances to the other.  The right to reign in the utopian impulses of the left, and the left to provide fresh ideas to keep the state moving forward.

Instead we now have two radical parties, each pushing for rapid change according to their own respective ideologies. Trump uncorked the populist genie, now the left will summon their own Saturninus.  Eventually someone will find a Caesar."
r/askreddit,"Actual conservatism, or the kind of ""conservatism"" that in practice often means ""revert everything our opponents added""?

I‚Äôve met plenty of people who are mostly liberal, until you find out they are big gun advocates (which I‚Äôm not saying there is anything wrong with). 

On the other side I‚Äôve seen plenty of conservative leaning folks embrace things like weed legalization and gay marriage as part of their stance that ‚Äúthis is America and you should be free to live your way‚Äù

The media pushes the agenda that we are two polar opposites, black and white, but most rational people fall in the grey zone. Only extremists promote the binary model.

All that said here‚Äôs my best attempt for both (as someone who has leaned both ways at different times)

Liberal in defense of conservativism- it would be nice to have it all, but we need to be realistic about what we can do for society/the world and focus on functional application. Also capitalism promotes fast growth, military is a necessity.

Conservative in defense of liberalism- if we want to remain a leader in personal freedoms we need to accept different lifestyles as long as they aren‚Äôt dangerous to others or themselves. Also the government and military are bloated. Also people should have more rights than corporations.

Case and point, I think we all just want to be free, safe, healthy, and have a bright future. Sometimes we just disagree on a plan, and politically extreme representatives constantly hold us back with red tape out of stubbornness"

r/askreddit,"It‚Äôs about balance. When either end of the spectrum is leading unopposed, bad things can start to happen, even if with the best of intentions. 

More specific to the US, the left is effective at finding and describing problems, while the right needs to be ‚Äúthe grown ups in the room‚Äù, challenging those conclusions to be certain they are correct and the evidence is solid. From there, they need to dig in to the tougher questions about potential long term fixes and how to afford them. In that role, skepticism is warranted, but not stubborn cynicism. 

The biggest problems for us right now involve the overriding influence of money in our system, and corruption of the republicans by religious and racial extremists- a fate they invited upon themselves via the Southern Strategy and not jettisoning every last shred of Nixonian cancer overboard when they had the chance. 

My longer term fear in this current situation has always been that GOP would be ultimately cratered by their own misbehavior and leave the Democrats unchecked. And that‚Äôs not because i dislike the Dems, but because their own leadership over the past few decades has been flawed and uneven. Add to that history‚Äôs track record of one-sided rule, and you can see a recipe taking shape for a potential shit sandwich for us and the world.

As a progressive ""liberal,"" I'm a huge advocate for eliminating government waste and excess bureaucracy.  I actually want to *eliminate* as many government jobs as possible through automation, reorganization, and other efforts to increase efficiency.  I want to end socialist farm subsidies and oil subsidies.  I think it's incredibly important to preserve individual liberty.

These are all traditionally ""conservative"" ideas, but in practice, conservatives in the US often enact the exact opposite."
r/askreddit,"Conservatives are mostly right about wanting personal choice and freedoms while liberals are right about things like healthcare and proper social safety nets for the poor and disabled. 

the biggest problem both sides have is that many of their members like to overreach and try to implement laws that conform to their own personal sense of morality instead of trying to genuinely create an actually free society.  

the EU is a perfect example of this on the liberal side, its a wonderful place to live but the governments of those nations love to implement ridiculous laws and rules about things they have no business interfering in like peoples porn habits or portion sizes in restaurants and other things of that nature."

Get in and start playing games on his wii, playing stuff I like, sports games and then sky landers, really cool for me, actually having fun, then we go to bed at 11 or so (really late for young me that always went to sleep before 9 and never later) 

About 1 am or so I‚Äôm woken up by an alarm clock going off(iPhone one) and AK gets up and I don‚Äôt think he noticed that it woke me up (I was in a mummy bag and in a kind of confused/tired state just laying still looking).

r/askreddit,"Anything ""ergonomic."". You take you take the way they design cameras and you can't hold it in your left hand because it's molded to be held in a right hand.  Computer mice are another example.  

It seems like more computers come with a less ergonomic version of mice oh, but anything you buy seems to be weirdly shaped for right hands.

Edit:. I appreciate everybody's observation that you can modify the operating system to flip switches on a mouse.  Which switch I click isn't the problem because I never changed the clicks.  My mouse works exactly the way a right-handed mouse works.

The problem is when the mouse is designed to be used for right-handed people.  See something like the Logitech m570.   there is no left hand version of this mouse and there's no way you can use this mouse with your left hand unless you compromise.  and that's what this posting was about the compromises that lefthanded  people have to make in this world.

I eat with a knife and fork as a right-handed person would, so am used to using a fork in my left hand.

When I'm eating a dessert with _just_ a spoon, I'll also use my left hand (it's very forky, in my head).

However, when there's a dessert that is best attacked with a fork and a spoon, I can't cope since one of the utensils would have to go in the wrong hand.

My family can't grasp this, as they usually use a fork and a spoon in different hands, being right-handed freaks.

Another similar thing is that I had a long handled dustpan and brush and the dustpan had a spiked bit to scrape hair off the brush, but only one one side so if you‚Äôre left handed you have to reach round.

I don't necessarily wish to change things from ever happening, per se.  But to be able to go back and face things differently when they did...sort of conquer it.  Well, that'd be quite the feeling wouldn't it?

r/askreddit,"So long as my loved ones would continue to exist in some other dimension - I don't want them to cease to be by doing this, as that would be horrific. But if they carry on, without me, then I think I'd choose to do this as I've just made so many mistakes."

r/askreddit,"Everyone of the tiny little perks students had were immediately taken away. 

No headphones on the school property (you used to be able to listen to music on headphones in the parking lot, not in the building), gone. No more baseball caps, gone, no more eating lunch outside when the weather was like, gone. No staying after school if you weren't with a club or activity. People used to just hang out in the halls after school and wait. Sometimes they'd be getting a ride from someone, or they'd be working on a joint class project. Couldn't do that in school anymore without direct teacher supervision. 

Some of these are things I understand. I get not letting kids wander around in a parking lot with headphones where there are lots of inexperienced drivers. I just don't know what that had to do with Columbine. There was a massive crackdown on things students could and couldn't do, and very little had anything to do with someone shooting up a school."
r/askreddit,"Everybody was just sad. There was no one saying ‚Äúeverything will be different from now on,‚Äù it was just depressing that this awful thing happened at a school not unlike your own. I don‚Äôt really remember any real policy changes happening until the following year."

I went to a school in a rough part of town. We made jokes about how ""It could never happen at Central, we'd just shoot back!""

I was one of the goth kids. Our little group all stopped wearing trenchcoats and toned it down a little, out of respect for the other kids.

I'm glad I have 20 years of distance between myself and high school. I still get an ache in the pit of my stomach when this day rolls around, though."
r/askreddit,"it was the first week of high school where I wasn't bullied

&amp;#x200B;

edit: In case anyone's wondering, It wasn't much better.  Being left alone because people think you might shoot up the school and murder a bunch of your classmates isn't exactly great for your self-esteem.

edit: Also, just to be clear, I was in no way thankful that Columbine happened.  I was bullied for most of my time in school, and that ended for good about a year later when I graduated.  There aren't bullies in College.  Life really does get better and if you think you need to act out violently to make it stop please get some help."
r/askreddit,"my best friend and I both wore trench coats and listened to heavy metal.

school administrators asked us to stop, and we spent the rest of high school with everyone giving us awkward looks waiting for us to shoot up the school.

they also took the school keys away from the couple of kids who had them, which was a real pain in the ass... I was on stage crew and it was fairly normal for us to be on campus after-hours or even on weekends working on the plays."
r/askreddit,"Was a trenchcoat kid, didn‚Äôt hear about it till I got to school the next day, got strip-searched. 
People were freaked out and wanted something to blame. 
All my friends parents‚Äô freaked out and wanted them to stay away from me."
r/askreddit,"I was a senior, and taking a bunch of shop classes to just tread water as I was done.  I wore mostly black shit and was into metal, but was just waiting to go to the army basically and was never a problem with anyone.

I had one class, digital electronics 3... Where we had to make circuit boards and program it to make randomized bird noises.   They gave us generic black cases and these little red buttons from radio shack.

Anyhow, day before Columbine my friends and I decided to make them look like bomb switches.   So instead of drilling holes for the speaker to this contraption, we drilled ""push for explosion"" or whatever.

Our teacher was fun, knew we were harmless and laughed

So Columbine happens, and me and my nerd friends are sitting at the lunch table putting these things together before class (because assignment was due) and this is shit we did all year.

And cops, administration.   We were told to put the devices down and back away from the table.   People came and inspected everything, lunchroom cleared... Our parents were contacted...

And nobody listed to anything we said.   We were assigned this shit, given this shit by the school.

All confiscated.

Things got wierd after that, and my mother actually got me a pack of white shirts.   I switched my black ones out for them and didn't bring my electronics out of the classroom.

Didn't have any more problems."
r/askreddit,"When Columbine happened, there was a lot of talking about what made it happen, military school, poor mental health, etc.

Being Canadian, it was more of a news story to learn from than something to fear...until within a few weeks there was news of attempted copycat incidents. That's when it stopped being talked about as something that happened and can't happen anywhere else"
r/askreddit,"At my school it was no different than usual.  People talked about it of course, but not unlike we'd talk about any other newsworthy event.  Back then school shootings weren't as common, or at least, not as much in the public conscience.  So there wasn't any kind of extra security or even an assembly to talk about it or anything.  I'd imagine some of the more outcast type of kids might have had a different experience though.  I can't recall if we had any of the trenchcoat wearing types."
r/askreddit,"Nothing I remember specifically that week but it sucked to have campuses shut down. Prior to Columbine people could come on to campus freely. For example, I came back to my high school to visit after moving to a different city. I hung out with friends and went to class with them. Wasn't a big deal. After Columbine you had to sign in at the front office, declare why you were there, etc. People just started thinking about safety a little more. Honestly though I wasn't really afraid of it happening at my school, though if run through scenarios in my head (just in case). It was more seen as a tragedy rather than a trend."
r/askreddit,"It was rumored some dumbass student threatened to bring a gun to school while in homeroom the next morning.

Otherwise life continued. Campus wasn't locked down. Fears weren't heightened in the kids. We were half the country away from Columbine. There had been a school shooting or two that had made nationwide news at that point, but it wasn't an epidemic.

During spring semester of the year before, kids were pulling fire alarms or calling in vague threats seemingly every other day. No one was scared. It was just an attempt to get out of class for a few hours. I watched a student casually walk over and pull the fire alarm one morning. There weren't cameras then and I don't know if she was ever caught or if administration really cared. The punishment for that type of thing was 10 days out-of-school suspension. All it meant was you automatically flunked the semester (on attendance rules!) and you could come back to school without any issues.

During that time in 1999, we were reading Hamlet. Within a week or two of Columbine, we went over the part where Ophelia has columbine flowers. The internets are giving its symbolism as unfaithfulness in a relationship. I'm pretty the notes in our version referred to it more bluntly as something like ""flower of sorrow."" That's stayed with  me more anything else about Hamlet."
r/askreddit,"I think a few days after we had a school assembly where we all stood in a rectangle circling the basketball court. The principal got on the mic and told us this was a 'bonding experience' to help us all realize we were not alone.


He asked ten questions, if you agreed then you take a step forward. If not stay still.


Questions including have you ever attempted to harm yourself or others, are you depressed, have you been bullied.... 


After the ten questions, he asked the two front most groups to follow him.


Apparently they were trying to weed out potential school shooters and everyone in the front most lines were suspended."
r/askreddit,Lots of people blowing up paper bags and loudly popping them in the hallways.  Students dramatically ducking for cover.
r/askreddit,"The day of, everyone was scared and quiet. The day after, they had an assembly to talk about it. The principal open up the assembly by saying ""It's a tragedy that so many young people lost their lives to such senseless violence. It's an even bigger tragedy that those kids won't be here to help pay for my retirement."" This was met by silence.

The day after that the had an assembly so the principal could apologize....."
r/askreddit,"I was in 10th grade. I vaguely remember conversations about it in English class the next day, and rumors flying about anyone who wore excessive black or Marilyn Manson t-shirts. That was about it. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt overly concerning because it happened so far from us combined with that mentality of invincibility teenagers often have (‚ÄúSomething like that won‚Äôt happen here.‚Äù). 

I remember Sandy Hook feeling like I was punched in the gut for two weeks after though. I was a teacher and a parent at that point."
r/askreddit,"Everyone in our high school generally started being nicer to the kids that were considered outcasts. 

When it happened and hit the news, our school went into full lock down. We had tvs in all the rooms and hallways and it was being broadcast live. Teachers and officials were worried that there was a network of people in this trenchcoat mafia and were about to execute simultaneous attacks in other schools.

After it ended, and the shock of the events started to subside, I noticed popular students were a bit more social with the more unpopular ones. Even just a hi to acknowledge their existence. It didn't last forever, but it was nice for awhile."
r/askreddit,"I was fifteen and living in Dallas when Columbine happened but what alarmed me most wasn't anything that happened around school (the worst thing was talk about a backpack ban that never came to fruition), what really worried me was hearing news reporters talking about how the shooters played Doom and listened to Marilyn Manson because I knew they were going to scapegoat the shit out of mass media and use the shooting as an excuse to try to impose censorship laws, especially on videogames, which were a big part of my life back then."
r/askreddit,Shitty. I was almost expelled because a friend of mine was stupid enough to write his own list in jest. I was number two on the list. But somehow because I was friends with him it was my fault for him doing it. My parents managed to talk the school into doing a two week suspension. My no longer friend got expelled and got his ass kicked by everyone who almost got expelled for his idiocy and he left the state and went to another school. The zero tolerance policies put in place after were awful and I feel bad for the students that have had their whole schooling under such a system. Kids are not really allowed to be dumb and stupid kids anymore.
r/askreddit,"It wasn't the following week, it was the start of the next school year for me. I was an incoming freshmen in Sept '99. I remember about a month in they started rounding up the ""weirdos"", calling them to the office for talks.... I was called in. I remember sitting between a Gothic kid and a heavy metal kid. They both asked why I was there....I didn't know. When my interview got started it was ""so you get bullied a lot...."" I was surprised and said no cause I really wasn't. He was like ""cmon....you wear a sailor moon back pack and have red sneakers."" I tried explaining I had a large friend group and wasn't an outcast or unpopular....didn't matter. I had two older sisters that never would have tolerated me being picked on....didn't matter. He was convinced I was terribly bullied and rageful over it and nothing was gonna change his mind. I changed tactics pointing out if he'd talk to anyone who actually knew me he'd know how against killing/harming others I was. It was deeply bizarre.... It was like he was trying to talk me into wanting to kill people. I never looked at adults the same way after that. To this day I'm a bit scarred about the fact that a group of adults in authority looked at me and saw a killer."
r/askreddit,There were some speeches and assemblies about bullying/violence and we started doing active shooter drills after that. The kids who picked on me left me alone for a few weeks which was kinda nice.
r/askreddit,"There was a definite shift in the attitude towards ""the anti-social kid"" who all of a sudden became ""that kid most likely to shoot up the school"". There was a lot of weird overreaction to trench coats, and the idea that this was all part of some sort of sub-culture. ""Trench Coat Mafia"" got thrown around a lot as some sort of thing to keep an eye out for. I even recall some blow-back on the release and marketing of ""The Matrix"" which featured promotional materials showing Neo and other characters in a black trench coats holding guns.  Basically, everyone became hyper-sensitive to ""the signs"" that a kid was a possible school shooter which honestly just served to further ostracize kids who were already the unpopular outcast type. In retrospect, it was similar to the hyper-sensitivity to Arabs and Muslims after 9/11."
r/askreddit,"I was in middle school at the time, but my sister was a freshman. I remember some idiot student thought he was funny and called in a bomb threat to the high school a week after Columbine happened. It was fake, of course. And he was subsequently suspended for a while.

Then there was all this obtuse stuff like banning trench coats and Marylin Manson shirts, as though those were the things that caused kids to want to kill other kids. 

I remember there was lots of talk in the media about blaming heavy metal, violent video games, and dark colored baggy clothes. Both in the actual news and those cheap daytime talk shows. Seemed pretty clear that nobody had any answers so they were looking for the quick and easy boogey man to blame instead of considering that those two kids had real psychological problems that were exacerbated by years of bullying and social isolation.

 Edit: Man, there are so many myopic comments here. It's possible to be both a victim and perpetrator of bullying. And it's also possible to have some friends and still have a perception of being isolated. Especially for a person *who is clearly mentally unwell, like a mass murderer for example.*"
r/askreddit,"Everyone remotely an outcast or who wore anything like a trenchcoat or just didn't look like the cookie-cutter Abercrombie kids was brought into the office and interrogated. They threatened to suspend people for wearing black or long coats, though I don't think anyone actually was and most people continued wearing whatever they wanted to.

Security got a bit tighter, but was already pretty tight to begin with so it wasn't much of a change. 

We had several class discussion about it, and anyone who was heard pointing out that the perpetrators being ostracized was probably a factor was again brought to the office and interrogated. That one happened to me - I'd made it clear there is absolutely no excuse for going on a shooting rampage, but wondered if a school culture of turning a blind eye toward bullying and a lack of mental health resources was a part of the context. Repeating this to the administrator interrogating me, he basically said ""well, if they would just be 'normal' it wouldn't happen"". Then I got a call home for rolling my eyes at him when he said that."
r/askreddit,Instead of adressing mental health my school banned backpacks in response. It was ridiculous. Our school was pretty big and going to your locker between each class wasn't always possible. One girl put her books in box on a skateboard and pulled it with a rope. The next week we could use backpacks again.
r/askreddit,"I used to wear a vintage Navy bridgecoat that had a bunch of sentimental value. It was comfortable and warm and kind of stylish, and perfect for the climate I grew up in. When I came in to school, I had no idea about the shootings - but the vice principal was waiting for me and gave me the option to give it to him for the rest of the day and not wear it again, or to keep it on and face expulsion. When he told me about the shootings I gave it up without a fight, and he told me to pick it up at the end of the day from the main office. 

End of the day comes, and when I picked up my jacket I discovered that somebody had shredded it with scissors. That day (and the days that immediately followed) taught me some valuable lessons about trusting other people.

Edit: RIP my inbox."
r/askreddit,"On the east coast so geographically removed, but one of my good friends had moved from Columbine where he would have been a freshman at the time. Even though the whole thing to me was just a story on the news, he was devastated because he knew the people impacted. It was really tough seeing him watch it all unfold from across the country. I never asked him about specifics but it was obvious that he had that dreaded mixture of relief that he was not there to be in danger and regret that he was not there to be helpful.

Edit: My first gold because a guy I went to school with 20 years ago had a well timed cross country move? I've dreamed of my first gold but I'm a little bummed it took a tragic anniversary to get it. Still...thank you! Hopefully I get more someday for bad puns rather than tragic memories."
r/askreddit,"I regularly wore a military surplus trench coat to school, because it was hella warm. And I also listened to heavy metal.

Needless to say, I got to take a visit to the guidance counsler's office, because apparently several of my fellow students decided I was guaranteed to shoot up the school."
r/askreddit,"My friend and I were arrested for wearing gorrila masks to the basketball game two days after the massacre.

r/askreddit,"Someone called a shooting threat into my school (it was almost certainly fake) and the principal told all the parents ‚Äúlisten, if you‚Äôre freaked out, your kids don‚Äôt have to go to school.‚Äù 

All my friends got the day off and played video games at my friends house, and my parents said ‚Äúno, this is bullshit, you‚Äôre going to school, sorry.‚Äù"
r/askreddit,"I went to a Marilyn Manson concert about a month later. My parents were not happy.

r/askreddit,"The whole country was hit by a wave of moral panic. False rumors were spread throughout the then-nascent internet. I was living in Guam, and our high school conducted active shooter drills. I remember some of my friends' parents wanted them to stop playing violent video games because they feared it would turn them into killers."
r/askreddit,"We got called to the office a lot more afterward for every little thing. Zero tolerance policies got started. Our group of friends was sort of outcasts but did nothing wrong but drink together on the weekends, maybe smoke some weed if someone had some. some harmless fun from some kids who had finally found friends, etc. but one of  the friends decided to call us the brotherhood, his best friends ever lol, makes a logo, nothing crazy, but  starts writing it on everything, his notebooks, locker etc. Then columbine happened and all of us get called into the office over gang related activities. ""what is this brotherhood?!"" ""what do you guys do?!"" ""are you a cult?!"" made it worse when I wouldn't tell them shit about what we do and laughed at them. no one did. ""this is serious stuff didn't you hear about Columbine?!"" basically the faculty lost their damn minds over it."
r/askreddit,"Big issues around students wearing Marilyn Manson t-shirts (I was on student council and I remember admin wanting us to ban the shirts). Seniors used to play ""Assassins"" with Super Soakers and that was banned (with the threat of detention of suspension.) Classes did it anyway, but it was never near the school. 

I went to college with a girl who survived Columbine. She didn't talk about it, but I don't blame her as it was still fresh in her mind and it was like people labeled her a certain way because of the experience."
r/askreddit,"I was a junior at Columbine. The week after feels like numbness personified. The only thing I truly remember is the amount of media. The amount of intrusion into our pain. The waiting to hear the names and the realization that they were gone forever. The nightmares. The tearful reunions. The realizations that childhood was gone and life would never be the same. 

Feels like a thousand years ago and yesterday all at the same time. 

The saddest thing though is that all the bullshit that each of you had to deal with after was fruitless. It didn‚Äôt stop it. It‚Äôs hard to feel hopeful that anything will anymore."
r/askreddit,"I went to a magnet school that included an engineering program. I remember not terribly long after some kids built a functional bomb (with no explosives) for a project. 

&amp;#x200B;

r/askreddit,"I was the goth kid (well still am) in HS that ran in the social circles of the people that looked like they could do a school shooting. My locker got searched, so were the lockers of a lot of people I knew. I remember in history class my teacher asked the class of they thought it's something that could happen here (HS was in NYC so no) and people looked at my  friends and me.

 I remember scoffing and saying something along the lines of 'I don't hate you guys enough to spend that much time plotting your murders.'  The rest of the school week was strange, but eventually settled down."
r/askreddit,"We didn‚Äôt hear about the extent of the shooting until I was at home. Couple things stand out. 1) news stations were obsessed with tracing the shooters steps through the school. Ex: started in the cafeteria where they killed 3 students, then walked to the library and executed 7 more with assault rifles. They were also constantly showing helicopter video of the students running away from the school though a field while they were getting shot at. Pretty explicit and fucked up. 2) people were much more conscious of threats and took them more seriously. Before, we would jokingly say things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to kill you!‚Äù And then have a laugh. Someone jokingly said that after Columbine and our group of friends got serious and told him that you can‚Äôt say that anymore. That just always stuck out to me as something that made me realize that the world was going to be different after that day."
r/askreddit,"they locked all the entrance doors but 1 and took everyone's pockets knives away, it was very annoying.

i don't think anyone was afraid of a school shooting, this was in nebraska where half the students had a shotgun out in their truck in the parking lot."
r/askreddit,"I was a junior in high school. This was one of those rare loss-of-innocence type moments, like 9/11. A nothing-will-ever-be-the-same moment.  


The security camera footage was like...a cursed cultural artifact. As an adolescent boy, I wasn't very emotional or scared; but I finally knew what the word ""chilling"" meant. It was the most haunting image I had ever seen.  


When an adult (teacher) could muster anything to say, which wasn't often, we were encouraged to be better to each other. I don't know that anyone was. Looking back, something was supposed to change; like...how could this ever be allowed to happen again?  


I don't know if anyone would've guessed that it would get worse, horrifically worse."
r/askreddit,"I was in the 5th grade when ot happened and I remember they dismissed us early. My mom worked nearby so she came and got me and I hung out at her office for the rest of the day. Every like 10 minutes some adult would come in and ask me if I was okay and not to be scared. Honestly, them coming in to reassure me made me even more scared than I was at the time"
r/askreddit,It was society wide shock. The same thing could happen now and you might not even hear about it if you're not watching the news.
r/askreddit,"My friends and I wore trench coats. We were the wanna be goth kids. It was basically harassment from there on in. I was actually getting a drug test for a job when the news broke it and was immediate fear from people. The next day at school the kids didn‚Äôt care but several of the staff did. One teacher actually grabbed me by the coat and told me how inappropriate it was. I told him just because some crazy person decided to do something wearing an article of clothing that I also wore doesn‚Äôt change who I am. He continued. I think I said something smartass in relation to either his being bald, white or fat and something negative in the recent news that he physically aligned with but only an idiot would suggest a similarly for. Do not pass go, do not collect $200, straight to the principals office.

Principal tried to make a big deal out of it. I was a senior, never had behavior issues, as a matter of fact I was well liked with friends of all cliques. I made good grades and was a participant in many school groups and functions. I asked the principal why he thought we/I would shoot up the school. He didn‚Äôt have an answer besides trench coat. They banned them but it didn‚Äôt keep several of us from wearing them. Ended up with on school suspension. It was only 30 days until graduation. Served time in there. It was hot as hell but I wasn‚Äôt gonna give in. I skipped school the last week (actually camps out for tickets to episode 1 for. Week with my friend) and then went to graduation. I remarked to the principal how much our graduation robes looked like trench coats (all black)  as I shook his hand and accepted the diploma. I had the coat on under the robe."
r/askreddit,"I was in high school in Canada.  I remember our principal gave us a heartfelt ‚Äúthoughts and prayers‚Äù speech but then went on about how ‚Äúwe should be thankful that we live in Canada where something like that could never happen‚Äù.  At the time it made us feel relief, and proud to be Canadian but now I realize how naive and stuck up that message was.  Different times I guess."
r/askreddit,"I was a sophomore and remember Eminem having a lot to say about it... think it was because Marilyn Manson was looked at closely for being an influence to Eric and Dylan. ‚ÄúSome dudes shooting bullets in your school and they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin... middle America now it‚Äôs a tragedy...‚Äù. I think White America mentioned something about it too. As for school, I recall it being broadcasted on television when I got home. Living in NYC, 9/11 was the one I remember more of. Just as tragic, but closer to home."

r/gaming,It's 4:20 somewhere always
r/gaming,"I remember looking at all of the ridiculous multiplayer trophies in that game being like ""well that's never going to happen.""  


Sadly right after the first expansion dropped the game became so laggy for me that it was unplayable, else I would probably still be on it. I think my internet at the time was also partially to blame."
r/gaming,The precision...it's...it's beautiful...

r/gaming,Nice.
r/gaming,"Older brother here, can confirm that that's the better controller. Trust me :)"
r/gaming,That dude looks like an off-brand Arin Hanson
r/gaming,As a oldest sibling I can confirm
r/gaming,"I'm the older brother. My younger brother got the shittier one because he turned it into the shitty one because hed never wash his unbelievably gross hands so it would get visible grime each time, buttons began to stick hard etc. it was sad to watch but at the same time gave me justification for why hed never use my good madcatz controller."
r/gaming,As the oldest I was told I had to let my siblings get their own way because they were younger. This would be my controller.
r/gaming,"Wish I could relate, but my family took care of our controllers."
r/gaming,Don‚Äôt you dare hand me that MadCatz shit.
r/gaming,This is all true
r/gaming,"More like. Here's a ball, throw into a Bush. Now go look for it for the next few hours."
r/gaming,"My brother and I used to play video games together (late 90s to early 2000s). 

Games such as Mario, Tank, Contra, etc on cartridges.  
He was much better than me so obviously he survived longer than I did in multiplayer games and I was most of the time AFK :("
r/gaming,I don't understand why people bought shitty generic controllers to begin with...  It's never worth it they're always trash.
r/gaming,"Man, those LEDs are super realistic, almost looks like the flames are coming out of the controller..."
r/gaming,Oh man I have lost so many good controllers because of my younger brother
r/gaming,"As an older brother I never gave them the shit controller because after years of being in a disadvantage they‚Äôd adapt and end up becoming better, I used the shitty controller and beat them"
r/gaming,As both an older and younger brother (the middle child) I can confirm..
r/gaming,It's 2019 and I'm seeing Silentwulf at the top of r/gaming.  What in the fuck is going on here.
r/gaming,"Older brother here. You were kind to let your younger brother play! My younger brother 'played' with the second player controller in all my single player games.

...the funniest part was him one day finding out (they grow up eventually!) we lied and that games can be hard. 'But mashing all the buttons quickly used to win in Mario!'"
r/gaming,"Middle child who's siblings didn't like video games, here. Both controllers are mine. &gt;:)"
r/gaming,"You got a controller? Lucky. I was able to watch older bro play single player games, but only was deemed worthy enough to play and get beat at 2 player games until I cried."
r/gaming,"We always got the busted controls from my step dad, like no right bumper or the left joystick was busted off so you had to kinda just use the broken nub. If I can find the controls I‚Äôll post a link here."
r/gaming,This could also be used for people bringing in controllers at the game store I work at.
r/gaming,Growing up as the only brother :(
r/gaming,"Older sister here, can definitely confirm."
r/gaming,Being an only child means I only get the best controllers
r/gaming,I specifically remember throwing multiple tantrums because I was the youngest and always had to have the ugly controller
r/gaming,My brother was playing with wireless controllers in the early 90s üòÇ
r/gaming,Dude looks like Daryl from TWD
r/gaming,"""ok then you can have it. You don't have to be nice to me i'll play with the bad one you have plugged into 1p"""
r/gaming,CAN CONFIRM
r/gaming,"Or, or plugging in the second controller on a single player game anyone?"
r/gaming,Budget Norman Reedus
r/gaming,As a younger brother I can say this is 100% true
r/gaming,Younger brother and the friend everyone was mad with got the mad catz controller
r/gaming,I'm a guy and have an older sister who always gives me the best instead of taking it for herself and I also have a younger sister who I do the same for. I wonder how different it would be if either of them were boys.
r/gaming,"As the younger brother, I cannot relate. 

My older brother didn't play video games with me."
r/gaming,"Well yeah, that controller is literally on fire!"
r/gaming,[deleted]
r/gaming,"Maybe he was just waiting for that sweet, sweet release that only death can bring"

r/gaming,Fable 2 is still one of my favourite 360 games. So many hours of my life wasted at the Bowerstone Blacksmith earning enough to buy property.
r/gaming,"I loved the descriptions of everything in the store in Fable 2. My personal favorite is the crunchy chick. ""It's the bones that make these crunchy."""
r/gaming,I need a new fable
r/gaming,"I miss Molyneux hype. I remember an article in EGM or PC Gamer where they interviewed him before Fable 1 came out. He was asked about B&amp;W2 and said the detail in it would allow for the camera to zoom in on an apple and see a small worm wriggling out of it.

Nobody lies like he used to. And he always got me to believe."
r/gaming,"I wished Fable 2 would come to PC. I love it, so."
r/gaming,Ahh Fable 2..... little work got completed that semester
r/gaming,"Fable 2 was a great game, Fable 3 though not so much"
r/gaming,"I've bought so many copies of Fable over the years.

Original, TLC, Anniversary on pc and Xbox, two ~~on pc~~ and Xbox twice, three on pc and Xbox also twice..

Love those games. 3 is the least good but I still regularly play through all three.

Edit: Oops. Must have played 2 on an Xbox using my PC monitor."
r/gaming,"PLEASE bring this game to PC. I want to play it again so bad, but I don't own an Xbox."
r/gaming,I'm in the process of replaying Fable 2 and 3 right now cuz I recently got a 360 for $10 lol. Just wanted one cuz I was dying to replay the Mass Effect trilogy and Witcher 2 and then I realized I could redownload Fable 2 and 3 as well. Wish I could find a cheap copy of Condemned 2 and Dead Space as well
r/gaming,That game made me want to be a voice actor for video games.
r/gaming,Fable is still my favourite Xbox game ever. Fable 2 and 3 were a bit of a let down for me really.
r/gaming,I would love Fable on the switch
r/gaming,"Worms aren't bugs or insects! 

Sheesh, and *who would expect lazy writing from the people who made Fable?*"
r/gaming,I still have my first physical copies from each launch in the franchise. RIP Fable
r/gaming,I loved these games. It would be great to see a Fable 4.
r/gaming,Fable comedy was gold. Fitted perfectly.
r/gaming,This game brought my wonderful wife to become a gamer!
r/gaming,I love the british humor of Fable and Overlord
r/gaming,Fuck man I miss fable 1 and fable 2. They really need to make a game like fable 1 but add online features.
r/gaming,One of my favorites. Loved how good/evil based decisions  could alter your characters look.
r/gaming,"Fable 2 messed me up. I'll never get over taking the honourable choice and sacrificing my dog and family to resurrect the people that died in the construction of the Spire. Mostly just really bitter about my dog, I couldnt care less about my wife and child lmao. But it was the choice my Sparrow would have made."
r/gaming,Wow I miss that game
r/gaming,My first time playing this game an orb flew by and gifted me 200k in game currency
r/gaming,"Ah yes, countless hours spent being a blacksmith to get the profit rolling. 

I still play occasionally bc its backwards compatable, I've done every possible thing. I have an unhealthy amount of gold and the only thing that brings me joy (besides my insanely upgraded/ expensive weapons fitted with health stealing augments) is bringing idiots to my evil temple and sacrificing them."
r/gaming,"I'm surprised at these comments honestly. Of all the people I knew, none of them liked Fable 2. Like legit I have never met someone who liked any fable other than 1. It's whatever, like what you like. But because I never met anyone who liked them I always just assumed nobody did."
r/gaming,"Agreed, I've missed those games since I swapped to PS4 a couple years back."
r/gaming,I just reinstalled it tonight. I need to do another play through.
r/gaming,Goddamn thats some big dick nostalgia
r/gaming,"I would love a new Fable, but I will still gladly take Fable 2's PC port instead."
r/gaming,I can definitely say that Fable 2 first and then Fable 3 changed totally my vision of single player videogames. This was an awesome series that had a too short life. That way to make all the game hilarious and putting jokes kinda everywhere was something superb. I really need a new chapter.
r/gaming,Obey! I command you to eat this Apple.
r/gaming,One of my favorite games
r/gaming,"I wish this would come out on pc, recently played the lost chapters as a compromise

I guess I‚Äôll just have to dig out the 360"
r/gaming,Literally doing another play through of fable 2 right now.
r/gaming,"How can you get a copy of fable 2 ? XBOX store ?

I want to play fable 2 but i can't find a code/key of it , and my local store don't seems to have physico copy of it .

Is there any platform able to buy this game digitally ?"
r/gaming,The game that made me love RPGS
r/gaming,90 percent of my childhood was spent on this amazing game lmao
r/gaming,I miss those games
r/gaming,"Are you playing on Game Pass? If so, does it look pretty good?"
r/gaming,This game needs to be on pc
r/gaming,I would do unspeakable things for a Fable mmo.
r/gaming,"**MEDIOCRE!!**

**EXCITING!!**

**BORING!!**"
r/gaming,You know I always forget in the original fable that you don't get super huge naturally and that it's a glitch you can produce to always look like you are in berserk mode.
r/gaming,I want the trillogy for PC T_T
r/gaming,"Wasn't that supposed to be the best fable?

I was upset that pc owners missed out on it."
r/gaming,"This game alone was the reason I bought an X-box 360. Sure, I kind of regretted it a bit later down the line when loads of Playstation exclusives came out that I really wanted, but the amount of hours and playthroughs I got out of Fable 2 was amazing.

On a much later playthrough I loved making my character completely 'Pure' but completely Evil - by basically giving free housing to everyone, rent free - but also going around killing people. Made your character pale but beautiful, like a vampire.

They really tried to dumb-down Fable 3 and I didn't like it as much, very sad about 'Fable Legends's failure and the closure of Lionhead Studios..."
r/gaming,And the story picks back up?
r/gaming,"Maybe they‚Äôll make an Old Kingdom game, or a game which takes place after The Journey but with guns gone!"
r/gaming,Flaccid celery!!!
r/gaming,Ey! Chicken Kicker!
r/gaming,That menu ui is so dated now the blade dashboard is a thing of the past

r/gaming,These games are great...anybody know how to play Fable 2/3 on pc?
r/gaming,I love the Fable-series.
r/gaming,(X) Doubt
r/gaming,"In all truth I liked all 3, wish they could make a remastered trilogy for the upcoming ""Xbox two""...or the switch since there all buddy buddy now lol"
r/gaming,"This is good


And yes my mum actually wants a fur suit"
r/gaming,I love this game. It makes me sad how few people I know that also played/appreciated it.
r/gaming,This brings back memories of grinding for days on end to unlock castle Fairfax
r/gaming,Damn better then anything I could do so yeah very good I give it a 10/10
r/gaming,As someone who is over 3-times older... this is better than anything I can do. Kid's got a future if this is where she wants to go. Easy 10/10.
r/gaming,"Link looks sassy, dope drawing."
r/gaming,"There is no way this child thinks they can't draw.

Children are not oblivious to other children's drawing ability for frame of reference."
r/gaming,"That‚Äôs fucking amazing, especially for a 12 year old!"
r/gaming,"technically speaking theres a lot wrong here, but shes 12 and not trained im guessing so its great!"
r/gaming,"Priorities straight too, left handed link &gt; heathen right handed link"
r/gaming,"I‚Äôve been drawing since I was 3 and The Legend Of Zelda is my favorite series and has been what I drew thus far, there is a lot that can be improved upon as it is good for a 12 year old but as her parents also keep an eye on the artistic path as having followed it myself it beats it out of people and I‚Äôve heard it from so many artist, I have a friend who‚Äôs super trained at drawing bird like creatures who‚Äôs been contacted by gaming companies and he‚Äôs significantly better, tell you daughter I love her Link drawing and to keep striving onward but for you my dear parent, beware of the artist path for her, it‚Äôs a payoff if successful but a very risky one too but people may see my message as bad but I wish her the best and hopefully not too many are offended by this"
r/gaming,velociraptor arm
r/gaming,naa sorry she cant really draw
r/gaming,Your 12 year old is correct in her statement
r/gaming,it is ok
r/gaming,The lack of right arm looks more wrong the longer I look. You should really respect her opinion more.
r/gaming,Wow. Never saw a 12 year old who is THAT right
r/gaming,"She's being modest for the praise. 

I know that's what 12 year old me would have done if I had any actual proficiency in anything."
r/gaming,You posted only the drawing and not your daughter. Smart move...
r/gaming,"If I could draw that well at 12 I would be significantly better than I am now (26).

She should be proud of that. Yes there are issues but no art is ever perfect and a lot.of things like proportion and dynamic stance are already starting to come through well. That's badass for someone who ""cant draw"".

Give her a high five and another box of pencils. :)"
r/gaming,I love Mario
r/gaming,"I'm an artist. I like to do hyper-realistic art.

Art is not a talent and whoever says that is full of shite. Art is a finely honed skill.

Your kid is on the right path, keep her drawing and support it. Don't let her compare herself to other artists, but rather tell her to use reputable artists to improve and modify her own style. No two artists are going to draw something exactly the same and as such her art is just as good as another's in her caliber.

She is really good for her age! Get her in some classes, OP!"
r/gaming,I mean for a twelve year old it's amazing
r/gaming,"Cool style, keep working on it and it'll only get better. No one is innately good at drawing. Those who do it most do it best. If she loves it, don't let her own critiques keep her from growing. But don't tell her to give them up either, as they'll push her to improve indefinitely."
r/gaming,When I was 12 I could draw some dope-ass stickmen.
r/gaming,"Most smart people think they are stupid.

Because they see it can be done much better even tho it looks awasome to others.

What people with high IQ suck at is to make market themself. Often they get abused because they do it for the fun and challenge and dont see the marketvalue behind it.

Look after your child and let her discover the world of art üëèüòâ"
r/gaming,How can she not think that's good. It doesn't have to be like Picasso or van Gogh. If she keeps at it she could be then next da Vinci in 30 years for all we know. I used to do more art when I Was younger and I had a teacher that said that going from childhood into your teens is when most people quit drawing . This is because they are too self-critical. Make sure she gets the message and continues into an age where she won't get herself down.
r/gaming,Tell her it's like link from the ocarina of time with breath of the wild graphics. I &lt;3 it
r/gaming,These are the best because artists always start this way and then do side by side with their even more incredible art like 5 years later
r/gaming,Fun fact I liked to draw since I was 6 and I drew my first fan art/masterpiece when I was 12 ( I drew a fan art of bloodborne btw)
r/gaming,[deleted]
r/gaming,This picture looks really cool! Your daughter has to keep drawing!
r/gaming,Don't tell her that.
r/gaming,When I was 12 I had problem with drawing straight line longer than 5 inches
r/gaming,"That's amazing. Whether or not you are able to persuade her that her art is good, I hope she keeps at it. She IS good, but even if she weren't, that's no reason not to draw and enjoy drawing. I enjoyed the heck out of drawing as a kid even though most of my drawings weren't that great (with the exception of stuffed animals and transforming robots, I can't draw squat.)"
r/gaming,I'm the opposit. I'm 21 and can't draw nothin' boy. Looks real nice
r/gaming,"A true artist will always see the flaws that others don't. Maybe her saying she can't draw is a way of saying she wants to improve even more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Excellent drawing."
r/gaming,My wife is an artist and she has been teaching me how to draw for the last 4 or 5 years now and your daughter is still much better than I am. I do great stick figures though!
r/gaming,For being 12 years old this looks good! The only major criticism I have with it is the tiny Hylian Shield and a missing right arm. For a shield that size you should be able to see his elbow and upper arm on the right part of the shield in a defensive position.
r/gaming,"She‚Äôs great at drawing, I could maybe barely do a stick figure with a pointy hat and even then I‚Äôd have to label what it was. She doesn‚Äôt even need to and I straight away know it‚Äôs Zelda"
r/gaming,You should show her the scott pilgrim vs the world art.  It's similar to this and made the creator money.
r/gaming,She can most definitely draw incredibly well
r/gaming,Parts of this remind me pf Windwaker Link.
r/gaming,Ah shit that's better than what I can do
r/gaming,"Fuck, I'm almost 20 and can't draw a quarter as well as that. Kudos to her!"
r/gaming,My step daughter started off doing drawings like that and it's developed into an amazing talent and something she studies at college. Your daughter will be amazing too!
r/gaming,"&gt;*Zelda looks great, but where does the link go to?*"
r/gaming,My sister has been practicing for about a year now. She's 30. She's only slightly better than this.
r/gaming,Great work! Never stop drawing!
r/gaming,She seems to have a good base for developing good sense of proportions. Definitely can grow it into something great if she keeps on practicing and grows into her style.
r/gaming,"She's way better than I am already, great job"
r/gaming,"Tell her that she's better than a 34 yo, haha. Seriously, tho, that's pretty dang good. Would she be interested in taking classes? It might give a better perspective as to where her skills are at and would likely take her skills even further"
r/gaming,He come to town!!
r/gaming,I draw myself and all I can say is that anatomy is amazing like can I have that.
r/gaming,I can draw like that and I say I can‚Äôt draw. That‚Äôs very relatable
r/gaming,She wants to improve herself. Get her in touch with other artists and if possible let her enroll in an arts course
r/gaming,"If this is 'not drawing', tell her to 'not draw' some more..!"
r/gaming,"She can draw, there is no doubt. All I want to see is her version of a better drawing than this."
r/gaming,"If your kid loves drawing, help give them the skills to support the passion, start with this:

https://www.alexhays.com/loomis/Andrew%20Loomis%20-%20Fun%20WIth%20a%20Pencil.pdf"
r/gaming,You need to keep this kid drawing. They have a huge potential.
r/gaming,Her coloring is also on point
r/gaming,"She can do that aged TWELVE?

Bloody hell. She has great talent. She really nails the essence of the character as well."
r/gaming,She shouldn't doubt herself
r/gaming,"Ngl this is really good, better than anything I can draw tbh lmao"
r/gaming,"And if she keeps drawing it will only get better than it already is. Art takes practice just like everything else.

Again it's a great drawing. I hope she keeps drawing."
r/gaming,I LOVE SO MUCH! The detail :0! It /is/ awesome ‚ô°‚ô°
r/gaming,She keeps this up and she'll have a credit on our favorite video games in 7 years.
r/gaming,"That‚Äôs actually really decent! If she really likes drawing then tell her to practice more, and learn patience, sketching nowadays is only popular in the animation community, but sadly, neither sketching nor animation gets as much attention as other things like that *horrid and shitty app they call gacha studio*.

Also if she‚Äôs really into art, it‚Äôs best not to sugarcoat every single thing you say about her works, it‚Äôs okay to give your opinion once in a while so your kid doesn‚Äôt grow up to be sensitive, not just that, that critique you give will be foundations for future improvements."
r/gaming,A million times better than anything I could do
r/gaming,"And I think I can‚Äôt play guitar.

I‚Äôm not a fan of these kinds of titles, but the drawing is very good."
r/gaming,Some random 20-something on the internet also thinks her work is awesome.
r/gaming,"I think when I person says ""I can't do this thing"" it's often because they compare what they are doing to other people. If she continues to improve on what she already knows, she's better than most people in the world already.

This is a great drawing! Keep encouraging her! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
r/gaming,Wow I can barely draw a straight line!
r/gaming,She should practice drawing from life! Then no one could say she can't draw. Get this child an apple and a set of pencil crayons :)
r/gaming,I cant draw whatsoever... and then I see this... its crazy
r/gaming,Damn! I think it's good!
r/gaming,"looks good. tell her to take more time on the colour, as i imagine thats why she thinks it looks bad- or try greyscale."
r/gaming,"I don't think I could replicate this, just from tracing.

""No art skills"" *pffft*"
r/gaming,HOW COULD SHE THINK THAT SHE DOESNT KNOW HOW TO FECKN DRAAW! I'm 12 and that is so much better then the crap I make my gaw she even colored well like wha- that us feckin amazing!!
r/gaming,"Her style reminds me of my own art when I was her age! I have a career as a designer now. She's doing great. :) It's not about being perfect at her age. It's about enjoying herself and the desire to get better as time goes on. Even though I'm 18 years older than her now, I STILL feel like I'm not as good as I should be. It's the curse of every artist, haha. I have plenty of artist friends who are amazing but are super critical of themselves. You just have to enjoy every small improvement you make with each new drawing. Tell her she is on the right path and just enjoy the ride!"
r/gaming,So cute. Well done :)
r/gaming,WhY dId ShE lAbEl HiM aS lInK hIs NaMe Is ZeLdA
r/gaming,Ive been drawing for a few years and this is still better than anything I can do
r/gaming,"Nah she‚Äôs pretty bad, but cmon she‚Äôs 12 haha... clearly she‚Äôll be good based on this if she keeps going."
r/gaming,"It's better than what I can do, but not as good as what some kids can do. 

She can draw, but maybe her belief that she can't is what will push her to do even better. 

I had issues throughout my childhood because my mother always said everything I did was great, and therefore I never pushed myself to fulfill my potential. I'd do the bare minimum, get her approval, and then quit. 

I didn't break out of that mindset until I was 25."
r/gaming,"This is what I wish to achieve. My only problem with this, is that I‚Äôm 14, and I‚Äôm still trying to draw like that."
r/gaming,She can‚Äôt draw
r/gaming,Practice makes perfect!
r/gaming,She draws wrinkles better than I ever could. That's something that takes a while to perfect. 10/10
r/gaming,She right. She can‚Äôt draw... anything that isn‚Äôt awesome
r/gaming,"Damn, one of the few times that old saying is true ‚Äúyou‚Äôll always be your harshest critic‚Äù"
r/gaming,That's really good! And show her a few art videos on YouTube. I restarted art last year and YouTube guides have helped me progress like crazy!
r/gaming,"This is awesome - please encourage her to keep it up. She's great now, but in a few years she could be absolutely amazing!"
r/gaming,Your 12 year old is a certified badass. Keep on keepin' on. Never stop never stopping.
r/gaming,Wow that¬¥s great. I wish I could draw like that-
r/gaming,Watch out for some major self esteem issues...this is a huge red flag
r/gaming,I've grew up taking several years of art classes and my mom is a professional artist. I've never even gotten close to this 12 year olds skill level. Fuck me.
r/gaming,She has talent. You tell her to keep at it. I'm in my 40s and wish I could draw even half as well as she can!
r/gaming,I am confused which line is the mouth.
r/gaming,"I heard something that basically I sum up as ‚Äúif you are satisfied with  your work you probably aren‚Äôt going to grow as much as an artist.‚Äù

That dissatisfaction(a healthy amount) is what drives us to improve. 

Obviously this is great work and I would never stop you from encouraging her but it sounds like your daughter has that drive and will probably get much much better(and still not be totally satisfied:))"
r/gaming,Keep it up!
r/gaming,This drawing is pretty
r/gaming,Your 12 year old can absolutely draw And she knows it. She has more talent in that regard then I do in... anything.
r/gaming,"This looks so good! Tell her to keep at it, she‚Äôs got some real talent üòÑ"
r/gaming,Okay sure thing dude.
r/gaming,Awesome drawing! :)
r/gaming,"Your 12 year old thinks she can't draw? I'm sorry, but this is the fucking Mona Lisa compared to my skill at drawing, and my skill at drawing? I can literally only do letters, numbers, and stick figures. I'm actually alot better at art if I use photoshop instead of physically making it.

My point is that she shouldn't degrade herself because she is not confident in her artistic skills, as there are other people who just straight up can't draw as good as her."
r/gaming,Draw 80 times better than me haha
r/gaming,Lmao how many of these posts are gonna make it to front page
r/gaming,r/linkishot
r/gaming,man i still can only draw stickmen and no that isnt a joke dont judge i would for sure give this a reddit gold if i had money for it
r/gaming,"""Ugh I just can't draw""

*draws*"
r/gaming,Better then me in all my 30 years lol keep it up üëç
r/gaming,"It's pretty good for 12.

Tell her though, if she wants to get good, to keep doing it, and do it regularly.

I draw some cartoons but I got lazy with it in my tweens, and sometimes might go a fortnight without touching a pencil. If I'd been more on the ball I'd be way better now.

This is a great start, but with commitment and a willingness to learn she could be astounding in a small handful of years."
r/gaming,nice! please tell her to keep up the good work! üëç
r/gaming,"A bit of advice: You telling her that she is actually talented as an artist is a great, valuable reinforcement.

BUT if you *also* communicate to her that her ability to sit down and put the time and effort into making this art, that is literally the most important skill in the world. Reinforce *that*, and your kid can do anything."
r/gaming,I can send her my drawings so she could feel better
r/gaming,That's really impressive! I'm literally speechless! ü§Ø
r/gaming,"her art IS awesome! There's so many more art tutorials up and around now a days then there were back when i was her age, so she's starting out really really strong! There's always time for improvement as life goes along. Can't wait to see where her art style takes her!"
r/gaming,If she keeps that art style up she could do some impressive things with an iPad...I would seriously consider a commission for character art for conventions.
r/gaming,"Not only is that good, but she draws fingers better than 90% of artists."
r/gaming,She can do way better than me
r/gaming,This is great! The only difference between professional artists and 12 year olds is time perfecting the craft. I don‚Äôt expect a 12 year old to perform surgery as well as a surgeon.
r/gaming,"She's right it looks li... I mean, this is wonderful 10/10"
r/gaming,Looks bad
r/gaming,"This is amazing for any age! Practice makes perfect, but your kids got serious talent already."
r/gaming,"It looks like she's already developed her art style. This is good but if she keeps at it, she's gonna be real good."
r/gaming,damn sick drawing
r/gaming,"Tell her to look into the Don't Starve style of art. It's not exactly that, but it reminds me of it. Overall, very good Link!"
r/gaming,Why does she think that she can't draw? If she can't draw then I wasn't even using my pen properly
r/gaming,She's got a solid start
r/gaming,"Tell her that hundreds of strangers on the internet love her art!


It‚Äôs incredible!"
r/gaming,"I think i can feel her: At her age i was always drawing and working to improve my art because i knew i could do better.

Don't mistake me: That drawing is amazing, but if she thinks she can do better or that she isn't good enough don't just say to her that ""her art is awesome"": Encourage her to keep drawing and improve by it!

It feels great to take a look back at one's old art and see how much did one improve, and it feels even better when people you love and care show interest in your progress.

Now i truly want to see more drawings from her and watch how she improves!"
r/gaming,"What is it with good artists always saying their art is bad?
Oh wait it‚Äôs because all good artists both enjoy art and are critical enough of their own art too self improve. Meaning they spend their free time drawing and getting better at it until they are pretty damn good.
Fudge I wish I enjoyed art as a kid ;-;"
r/gaming,The details on that shield !
r/gaming,Get her an art teacher ASAP. Talent like that is pretty rare.
r/gaming,"Well to be fair, you are biologically programmed to think that"
r/gaming,I can barley draw a stick man...
r/gaming,If we allowed everyone's crappy drawing this place would suck. It's only good to you because you knew who drew it.
r/gaming,That‚Äôs an awesome job. Definitely keep encouraging her to draw! She‚Äôs got some real talent.
r/gaming,This. Is. Amazing.
r/gaming,Well I think she's doing great.
r/gaming,"HECK YES, GREAT WORK!


Keep it up!"
r/gaming,Fucking amazing as a artist myself I give her my blessings
r/gaming,"She's definitely got talent. I like the shield.

You guys are right, and I hope you keep encouraging her."
r/gaming,That‚Äôs a 12 year old‚Äôs art? *cries in a corner* üò≠
r/gaming,"I'm 19, and I can do stick figures, mostly, maybe some really simple trees if I try hard enough. I think she's doing ok. :)"
r/gaming,Incredible for a 12 year old. Surprised she hasn‚Äôt figured out that it‚Äôs Zelda though.
r/gaming,"Not holding sword right, shield unproportioned, wrong  color pants. 0/10"
r/gaming,When I was 12 I don‚Äôt think I could have even colored in the lines. There is just something about the temptation of going out of those lines...is it a trap? Perhaps. But I must try and stay within the lines.
r/gaming,She is good
r/gaming,"She draws better than I did at twelve.  Heck, she draws better than I do now at 28."
r/gaming,That 12 year old has extremely high standards... thats some quality work. I'd love to see some work they are happy with.
r/gaming,"i will fight all of your 13 and 12 yeah old kids and cousins who think they cant draw

&amp;#x200B;

I WILL PROVE I AM THE WORSE"
r/gaming,Better than me at least
r/gaming,"That's really, really good.  I especially like the detail on the shield (even if it is a tiny bit small) and the hair.  Has she done Zelda?"
r/gaming,üëç
r/gaming,Thanks Todd
r/gaming,"Oh, the mother of all DLCs"
r/gaming,"Oblivion is strange for DLC, it had both the best and worst DLC's of that generation."
r/gaming,"Ah, the beginning of the end..."
r/gaming,Saw Todd give a talk where he mentioned it was embarrassing how much money they made off this.
r/gaming,"I have such confusing feelings when it comes to purchasable DLC.

Obviously it sucks if the DLC affects gameplay and you can win just because you spent more money. But at the same time, cosmetic DLC blows my mind, too. I know this is just me personally, but I've been playing videogames for 30 years and have never cared about the clothes my character is wearing. When I see Choosing Beggar posts from people desperate to get the new Fornite shirt for their avatar, I  can't fathom it. You want to pay money to have a different color costume that doesn't affect anything? 

But again, that's just my personal view, I know that cosmetic purchasable DLC is pretty popular. And if they have the money and it makes them happy, go for it. It's just hard to figure out how I feel about it sometimes."
r/gaming,I wish to buy this horse armor but with fake money. Then I want that fake money to buy a box that will give me a small chance to earn a bit of pride and accomplishment.
r/gaming,A E S T H E T I C
r/gaming,Good old days.
r/gaming,Even the horse looks surprised somebody fell for it
r/gaming,Why is there just a weird bush?
r/gaming,A pure elder scrolls experience.
r/gaming,"Can confirm, purchased on Xbox live years ago and makes me cringe thinking about it today."
r/gaming,"I‚Äôm really different when it comes to DLC. The first time I remember seeing it, was the lost chapters version of fable. I was blown away at the thought of there being MORE of a game I loved that I‚Äôd played back to front. I don‚Äôt like microtransactions, but I‚Äôd be a liar if I said I didn‚Äôt enjoy and buy dlc. I love the idea behind it, and I think there are a million worse ways to spend five dollars. I play so many games, using so much of my time, I don‚Äôt mind further helping out game companies grow. There is a fine line between micro transactions and dlc, however, that needs to be seen and upheld"
r/gaming,"*shrug*

I remember waiting several weeks and then getting a coupon to get the Horse Armor And Tomes DLC for free because I bought the Wizard‚Äôs Tower or something.

The DLC on Xbox Live went on sale quite often, it was like Steam before Steam."
r/gaming,Gameranx?:)
r/gaming,Well someone watches Gameranx.
r/gaming,"People are calling this DLC, which I know is technically correct the best kind of correct, but I just don't like calling micro transactions DLC. DLC used to mean actual gameplay content not cosmetics. It's kinda like how I view the word APPs. It was originally used for phones, now anyone and everyone calls any software an APP."
r/gaming,Sleeping Dogs. Nice!
r/gaming,Come on. You know you won't be able to rest enough in those two hours anyway. Might as well game the rest of the night...
r/gaming,"An underrated treasure. God damn that game was fun.

Drunken Master was the shit."
r/gaming,Best game ever
r/gaming,"Oh shit a sleeping dogs meme, a surprise sure but a pleasant one"
r/gaming,This just means it's side quests 'til 5.
r/gaming,*insert persona 5 joke here*
r/gaming,"what's dx and, ac stand for?"
r/gaming,Morgana approves this message
r/gaming,Skip
r/gaming,F.
r/gaming,At that point im calling in sick. There's no way im going through the day with less than 2 hours of sleep.
r/gaming,Surely there‚Äôs time for a pork bun
r/gaming,Shit sucks lol
r/gaming,Sleeping dogs is a fukin classic at this point
r/gaming,If I'm gaming at 3 and have work at 5 I see that as more of a reason to keep gaming. 2 hours of sleep is worse than staying up.
r/gaming,Currently replaying Sleeping Dogs for like the 4th time. Just as amazing as it was back on 360. A truly underrated gem.
r/gaming,might as well just stay up at that point. I don't remember exactly but if you sleep an even 90 minutes you'll wake up right before your brain goes into deep sleep which will keep you aware and not horribly tired looking. If you do the 120 minutes it'll be too late and you'll wake up groggy and feeling worse.
r/gaming,great melee combat system for GTA clone.
r/gaming,I honestly feel like the only person who has never done this. Why would you do this on purpose.
r/gaming,"you obviously didnt drink or smoke nearly as much as i used to... thats maybe 3 months savings from my peak.

good on you! i quit both 2 months ago. miss it but wont go back."
r/gaming,Picture of box and game
r/gaming,"Jesus, that's like five nights of my drinking."
r/gaming,"Another week, another attention post with a switch."
r/gaming,"Good on you, but I have a question.. that‚Äôs like maybe $500 in stuff. Seems like you didn‚Äôt really drink or smoke that much imho.ü§î"
r/gaming,"Typical r/gaming post

Picture of a console or a bunch of video games with mini sob story for a title"
r/gaming,"According to OP he paid about $3,385 a year on cigarettes and booze a year.

A Nintendo Switch is $299.99, Mario Odyssey is $59.99, an SD card is less than $50, and an aftermarket controller is $50 tops.

OP is either horrible at basic accounting, or a liar. Probably both."
r/gaming,Next time don't buy the Nintendo branded s.d card
r/gaming,"That's like what, $600 usd? 

That's basically nothing compared to how much people actually spend on smoking/drinking. 

This is just a clear karma farm. You didn't quit anything. Just posting for karma."
r/gaming,r/WifeBoughtMeGame Straight-Edge Edition!
r/gaming,I will never understand why garbage posts like this get upvoted.
r/gaming,"Are Americans so impoverished that buying a switch is an accomplishment? This exact post, with varying sob story, has popped up so many times."
r/gaming,I can see you being able to afford the Nintendo gear but the lemon creme cookies are a little bit over the top.
r/gaming,"My mother quit smoking a year ago. This saved us thousands. Mom had decided to quit because i, being a faithful child who was mama‚Äôs boy, had guilt-tripped her everytime i smelled smoke on her."
r/gaming,Each day the male human species slightly looses some of their testostrone.
r/gaming,You obviously didn‚Äôt smoke or drink enough
r/gaming,1 week of no drinking or smoking would get me enough
r/gaming,"as a craft beer drinker my first thought was how that must not have been a lot of drinking

then came the wave of holy shit how much am I spending on beer thoughts

which I promptly killed with beer"
r/gaming,Congrats
r/gaming,A year? I just did the math and realized I spend nearly $1000 a month on beer and smokes. üò¨ I need to quit.
r/gaming,time to drink and smoke again !
r/gaming,"Bro, congratulations , you finally got the trail mix you wanted"
r/gaming,I need to start smoking and drinking so I can quit and save money.
r/gaming,Obviously weren‚Äôt a big drinker or smoker üòÜ
r/gaming,I've seen the price of cigarettes and booze.. that is enough for atleast 5 Switches
r/gaming,No smoking and drinking for a year and all you could save $300
r/gaming,More like 2 months of no smoking and drinking
r/gaming,Congratulations you gave up one unfulliflling addiction to pick up another
r/gaming,r/circlejerk
r/gaming,Bro no offense but I'm 12 and I bought myself a switch
r/gaming,Nice. Congrats!
r/gaming,waking up not hungover is awesome
r/gaming,I'd return that Mario controller and get the pro controller. That controller you have has limited functionality.
r/gaming,I literally just quit smoking weed on 4/20 to start saving for a PC
r/gaming,I wish I smoked so I could quit and buy a Switch.
r/gaming,Day five of no smoking. I want to kick things and scream outside at puppies
r/gaming,"Come to canada, thats like a 24 and a couple 40oz.

Alcohol is expensive here"
r/gaming,"Smoked two packs a day on average. Stopped smoking, got a bank loan and bought myself a beautifull '09 Bmw."
r/gaming,Amazing job and I'm sure your lungs and liver are proud of you as much as everyone is on here
r/gaming,"Jesus fucking christ a whole year to buy that?! Fuck Reddit, I‚Äôm done."
r/gaming,"How did you need one year for that? Im in switzerland and i can get this like every month, (no hate or something)"
r/gaming,That's awesome but for your next time buying an sd card I'd give you the advice to buy a normal sandisk one they're literally the exact same but cheaper.
r/gaming,For me 1 year of no smoking or drinking= 5k pc gaming rig
r/gaming,"Btw never buy those Nintendo branded micro sd cards, they're fine but if you were to buy the exact same SanDisk micro sd card without the Nintendo branding it would be like $30 cheaper."
r/gaming,"Congratulations OP, this is a true milestone in your life. Celebrate and have fun! :)"
r/gaming,1 year? This is about what I spend in one month of my drinking and smoking xD
r/gaming,thats like 200 bucks tops ? you hardly smoked and drank but still cheers
r/gaming,"Good for you dude. This is just the cherry on top of not killing your lungs. I was able to change my life around before, and quit anything else i got used to. But smoking is my achilles heel. I don't think i'll ever be able to stop, i went 5 days without smoking and was on the edge of killing someone. I've heard of people going 40 years without smoking and still getting that craving. fuck. that. i'd rather die early and keep smoking tbh."
r/gaming,Are you five?
r/gaming,Hell yeah!
r/gaming,I'm thankful every day I'm not that broke
r/gaming,must of bin a light weight.
r/gaming,Now that you got what you want you can go back to smoking and drinking!
r/gaming,if thats all you got after a year then you weren't smoking and drinking enough to begin with...
r/gaming,People quitting smoking is my favorite human success story.  Grats and well deserved!
r/gaming,Keep it up man
r/gaming,That's a great achievement! Keep at it!
r/gaming,Congrats on giving up your addictions!
r/gaming,"I never understood smoking. You smoke because you‚Äôre stressed. 
You‚Äôre stressed because of a lack of money. 
So you spend money on cigarettes so you end up more stressed so you need to buy more cigarettes?
My co-workers always complain that they hate smoking so much but they can‚Äôt stop. It can‚Äôt be that hard to quit. Just switch to beef jerky"
r/gaming,Really puts in to prospective how much a waste cigarettes and alcohol can be
r/gaming,Thats dope. Id post it on r/destinythegame
r/gaming,"Damn, ok...
I see you..."
r/gaming,Look soo awesome!!
r/gaming,Nice
r/gaming,Okay that's awesome
r/gaming,"Wow, that's so cool!"
r/gaming,"Is it a real gun or airsoft or just prop for cosplay or something?
Still awesome."
r/gaming,But does it imbue your thoughts with universal slaughter?
r/gaming,Can I have it?
r/gaming,Melee damage 50-80. Range damage 90-140
r/gaming,Yeah dtg would flip their collective shit
r/gaming,Nice
r/gaming,Taken glow effect not real. 0/10
r/gaming,*pew pew pew*
r/gaming,So when are we going shooting?
r/gaming,"Damn, that looks sick as fuck! Great job!

To bad they nerfed it into the ground."
r/gaming,Capitalizing each word like a dumbfuck made it difficult to decode the title.
r/gaming,That‚Äôs an interesting shirt
r/gaming,"Was this at a convention, or does your cousin walk around with a sharpie and zelda copy at all times just in case?"
r/gaming,"What a beautiful man on the right, holy shit your cousin is Shigeru Miyamoto!"
r/gaming,Lucky man
r/gaming,Plot twist: he is holding a gun behind his back and stole his zelda copy.
r/gaming,Miyamoto actually looks old for the first time in....ever. Still so energetic.
r/gaming,Damn shigeru looking all fine and dandy in that tie and coat
r/gaming,Your cousin is Michael Weatherly?
r/gaming,FF
r/gaming,"This man brought so much joy into our lives, can we get an F for Shigeru Miyamoto."
r/gaming,Was it Mac DeMarco? He did this when I saw him with the Flaming Lips a couple years ago.
r/gaming,"I hope they hired a speedrunner, cause that would blow a lot of their minds."
r/gaming,"Mac Demarco did that at Outsidelands 
Name: MAC
Favorite food: STEAK
Favorite thing: ROCKIN"
r/gaming,"If this doesn‚Äôt tell Nintendo we need a rerelease of Earthbound or just the entire Mother trilogy (including Mother 3), I don‚Äôt know what will."
r/gaming,I fucking love Mac DeMarco and I fucking love Earthbound
r/gaming,That‚Äôs so fucking cool im gonna go listen to that dude now
r/gaming,"I‚Äôve been video games all my life (since 1986) and some how never touched Earthbound. Does this series still hold up and is it worth playing today?

Should note; huge Zelda fan, bug Metroid fan."
r/gaming,"‚ÄúThis dude‚Äù

The epitome of your typical Coachella-that doesn‚Äôt know any of the artists performing."
r/gaming,Fuck you thats Mac Demarco
r/gaming,We need more game visuals for techno!
r/gaming,"Mac DeMarco is absolutely eccentric, but he is an amazing musician/songwriter."
r/gaming,Mac Demarco = Some Dude.
r/gaming,I fucking love Earthbound and Mother series
r/gaming,Heard ticket sales down 30 percent this year..
r/gaming,"CHON also does something similar at their shows. Lady tour I went to (called Super Chon Bros) they just had SSB Melee up playing in the background. It was sweet. 

If I‚Äôm not mistaken, I think they‚Äôre at Coachella this year, too!"
r/gaming,Wow what an ARTIST
r/gaming,He's in the year 3019 playing games on a backdrop while we're stuck in 2019 playing games on our TVs.
r/gaming,"'This Dude' bruh, that's the prince of indie rock himself."
r/gaming,...
r/gaming,"Not sure if you know of them, but a band called ""Bit Brigade"" speed runs games and plays the music along to the game.
I saw them live at PAX East this year. It was awesome! Such a cool experience."
r/gaming,"Makes sense, his music seems to bare a lot of resemblance to Earthbound's soundtrack. Actually might start listening to some of his stuff thanks to this."
r/gaming,I know it‚Äôs probably just a video...but I really hope the graphics person is sitting at front of house playing a video game
r/gaming,"There‚Äôs a band I saw a poster for, here in Nashville, that does speed runs of various games, and the band just plays the game music as the guy plays.

I didn‚Äôt go...but looked super dope."
r/gaming,Is that legal?
r/gaming,TIL Mac DeMarco is just a dude.
r/gaming,Didn't think I could like ole DeMarco even more. This is so cool.
r/gaming,"Earthbound.  The most archaic and nearly unplayable game that everyone seems to love.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Save the hate trolls, I have played the game numerous times and own it on multiple platforms."
r/gaming,[I've started playing it again too](https://i.imgur.com/xhTZR9I.png)

r/gaming,Are we not going to talk about the two guys who look identical except for their pants ????
r/gaming,"Wow, thanks for the comment. I think I will check this out üëçüèº"
r/gaming,why are those two people so much taller than everyone else? are they wearing stilts?
r/gaming,Well done
r/gaming,Great idea to use Porygon for this kind of art. Good work!
r/gaming,A time lapse of this drawing would be oddly satisfying.
r/gaming,The drawing is amazing but that thing looks creepy AF
r/gaming,Amazing
r/gaming,"Shit, I *just* had a drawing assignment and I needed one left. Chose a shot drawing of a cat. I should've done this lmao. I will next time!"
r/gaming,that's awesome!! are you studying art?
r/gaming,Porygon is a duck right?
r/gaming,I love this.  Porygon is my favorite.  Too bad he caused all the epilepsy
r/gaming,"Why so much Porygon lately? I saw a stage from smash, a gummy ship in KH3, now some sweet art. Is this all coincidence?"
r/gaming,"Didn‚Äôt sell well? [22 million units worldwide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles) puts it on par with the original Xbox and right behind consoles like the Sega genesis and N64.

r/gaming,"Paper Mario: Thousand year Door, Phantasy Star Online, Kirby's Air Ride, Timesplitters 2 and 3?! Gauntlet Legends Dark Legacy, Sims: Bustin' Out, Sonic Adventure Battle 2, I could go on and on, the games were and still are awesome."
r/gaming,Star Wars Rogue Squadron II and the Metroid Prime series is where I spent most of my time on the GameCube &lt;3

r/gaming,Completely off topic but thank you for posting a picture that recreates what I sometimes see when looking at bright lights so I can show my eye doctor
r/gaming,It says ASS
r/gaming,I think I just sat on that couch at Beck‚Äôs. That center seat‚Äôs back folds down and has more cup holders and electrical plugs right?
r/gaming,that looks comfortable
r/gaming,"Self made or part of the chair?
Because I want this"
r/gaming,I have the couch from this set. Part of the Delange collection from Coaster furniture. Couch also has a fold down table in the middle with 2 outlets and a power strip. https://www.coasterfurniture.com/furniture/delange-motion-power-sofa
r/gaming,Spider-man 2099
r/gaming,When your so poor in the year 2099 that you have to use 2013 tech
r/gaming,You live in 2099 and still play a ps4?! Wow! So retro!
r/gaming,Please. That's 2050 tops. If it were 2099 there would be a toilet seat instead of a cushion.
r/gaming,They still use cables in 2099?
r/gaming,"In 2099 they voted my couch the worst place to sit in America. Main reasons? Sky high rate of laziness and ass swamp. Can't deny it, its all true, but everyone want's to sit here."
r/gaming,"I thought it said ""A55"" but what are the different symbols?"
r/gaming," stupid question, can you charge the ps4 from any micro-usb? I had a controller die and I was afraid it did so because I plugged it  in to a normal outlet."
r/gaming,buy
r/gaming,"Tbh, I hope to God I don't need to charge my PS20 controller with a USB 2 cable"
r/gaming,"Yes, yes, the chair can *charge* the controller.  But, is the chair any good on the PS4?  What's its favorite game?"
r/gaming,"I have the same couch, v great"
r/gaming,Bobs Furniture ftw
r/gaming,"I‚Äôm sitting about 20 feet away from one of those in my furniture store. Lights in the cup holder and the buttons for the recliner are right there too! I hope you got the furniture protection plan, the whole thing can go out and it‚Äôs a pain to pay out of pocket to get it fixed."
r/gaming,"I work in the furniture industry. Usb outlets are standard in every sectional/theater seat we carry as of 2019. Our furniture is made by Manwah/Cheers, Natuzzi, and Palliser in case anyone is looking for something similar!"
r/gaming,"I went over to my uncle's house for Easter today, and he had this exact same chair/couch set-up. I played with the head and foot rest buttons for a good five minutes."
r/gaming,Ehh. I‚Äôve been to 2099. Wires don‚Äôt exist anymore.
r/gaming,"""Hold on let me just plug in my couch"""
r/gaming,hey we have the same couch!!!
r/gaming,...i think I've had that same couch for 3 years. Rushing home rn to check if it has usb ports.
r/gaming,*Laughs in battery*
r/gaming,But where do I poop?? Cuz I‚Äôm done pooping in my cup holder
r/gaming,"Wait I have relatives with that same couch. Shit, thanks for the tip"
r/gaming,Bying a socond controller so i could always have a fully charged one was the best decision of my life.
r/gaming,"I have the same chair. Best decision ever. It folds down, has storage for all your controllers on the sides. I get a blanket with heating under while gaming. Worth every penny."
r/gaming,I would be quite surprised if devices still charge with a cable in 80 years
r/gaming,Does that thing say A S S?
r/gaming,What is that futuristic cup holder and how do I get one
r/gaming,Is cyberpunk out yet?
r/gaming,Looks like some bullshit from Aaron's. Fucking power goes out and my couch stops working...nope.
r/gaming,"As if. In 2099 herds of carnivorous hamsters roam the earth, devouring all flesh. Do you think that we have fancy LED's and comfy couches in the dark future? We do not. If we are lucky, we dine on cold, raw hamster meat. Consider yourselves lucky, people of 2019."
r/gaming,Beware of Alchemax.
r/gaming,"Nothing says ""future"" like a wired controller."
r/gaming,What is that thing?
r/gaming,Let's hope by 2099 Sony can make a controller with a battery that lasts longer than 3 hours...
r/gaming,You think in 2099 there would be some sort of technology to clean off your greasy ass camera lens...
r/gaming,I thought the world would be uninhabitable in 12 years due to climate change
r/gaming,"silly boy, in 2099 we won't have couches anymore, our asses will have built in comfort settings"
r/gaming,Woah what is this?
r/gaming,2099 is when youll be able to put your mind actually inside the game
r/gaming,Anyone know where I can pick up the couch?
r/gaming,"I have done the same thing, but my problem is while I was playing it didnt seem to charge it any. It was just enough to keep it powered, but not actually charge it"
r/gaming,"Oh yeah totally. Wait let me check. Yep, star citizen still isn‚Äôt out yet."
r/gaming,Is it possible to learn this power?
r/gaming,RGB cupholders?! come on!
r/gaming,holy shit looks like I bought this model couch a few years too early. I have to kept the center console flipped down to use the USBs on mine.
r/gaming,You absolute legend
r/gaming,A cup holder that has charging ports? That seems like it might be a fire hazard. Is it waterproof or something?
r/gaming,I need this in my life
r/gaming,Shows the rest of the house.. Its a 4300 dollar trailer home
r/gaming,If only I could be so grossly incandescent.

r/gaming,This little lord gets my vote
r/gaming,Amazing and amazing photo
r/gaming,"That costume looks awesome, Nice pic"
r/gaming,"when i first saw this picture, i swear i saw it move ever so slightly"
r/gaming,Moms cool. She's like 'you want to do what?'. Ok just don't ever say i don't love you.
r/gaming,"I've never played Dark Souls, but thank you for writing 'lovely mother'. I'm grateful for your awesome relationship with her. As am I with my own beloved mom."
r/gaming,"Wow, incredible cosplay!"
r/gaming,If only there was a sword glowing in a bonfire.....
r/gaming,"That is excellent work!  On a related note, playing in Elite Knight armor is *literally* the only way I play Dark Souls I &amp; II, and I can't change! haha"
r/gaming,This looks like [[Gaea's Blessing]].
r/gaming,Legit! Props to your mom as well!
r/gaming,Now that's some cosplay I can really get behind. This looks just like the game. Really you've done a marvelous job. How's your sword look unsheathed?
r/gaming,What did you make the armor out of? I love it ‚úå
r/gaming,Great photo. I'm glad your mom is so supportive. My mom pretty much thinks video games are a scourge and refuses to have anything to do with them.
r/gaming,Refreshing to see an outstanding cosplay of one of personal favourite games :)
r/gaming,"AaaaAAAAAAhhhh, Ashen One..."
r/gaming,All hail Mom!
r/gaming,If only I appreciated my mother more for supporting all my stuff like this guys mom does for him.
r/gaming,You mean your elite Mother
r/gaming,Say hi to your mutha for me
r/gaming,But how did you get past the Hydra to get it?
r/gaming,"If you don't mind, could you tell me how you made the costume? I've always wanted to make a set like this"
r/gaming,Why so sad knight?
r/gaming,This is awesome. I'm currently wearing my dark souls shirt and that made me happier.
r/gaming,Awesome. Is there an album with more photos from this shoot?
r/gaming,You have an awesome mom! You‚Äôre pretty cool too
r/gaming,Good job Skeleton!
r/gaming,WHOA.
r/gaming,Looks great!
r/gaming,TIME FOR CRAB
r/gaming,"This is really amazing. IMO, this could be a Dark Souls poster or game cover. Really impressive and your mother has a great eye for photography."
r/gaming,"Feeling cute, Might die later, idk."
r/gaming,"Nice cosplay dude! Sadly, I'm terrible at doing anything social and would rather look at other people's cosplay."
r/gaming,"Nice, and your mom sounds awesome"
r/gaming,"Jesus Christ, it‚Äôs incredible! I wish I could be in lordran!"
r/gaming,Zero deaths
r/gaming,"This mom, she praises the son. Hehe okay I'll see myself out and awesome photo!"

r/gaming,Deus vult
r/gaming,That‚Äôs badass
r/gaming,"Awesome job OP! Aaaand now I got that song stuck in my head again ""I have been where you were before...."""
r/gaming,Awesome! Still my favorite looking armour in the series. It became the only armour I would wear in the first one.
r/gaming,Awesome Mom!!!
r/gaming,Yuuuusssss so good
r/gaming,"neckbeard, thanks to the internet."
r/gaming,"Absolutely gorgeous photo composition, props to your mom."

r/gaming,*sad crusade noise*
r/gaming,"I went to the Ren Fair for the first time today, its probably the best place to see cosplays like this without having to pay so much to go to a con, highly recommend it"
r/gaming,Nice jobs on both counts. Really.
r/gaming,Beautiful photo. You've made your mom a pro
r/gaming,Hey that‚Äôs me!
r/gaming,"Wow, this picture looks depressing, and I mean that in the best possible way. Really good job, and nice use of natural lighting. :) Really puts off a ""Dark Souls"" vibe, if that makes any sense a all."
r/gaming,"I approve. Very much so.

Anri would be proud."
r/gaming,Fantastic job! I look forward to your future projects. Praise the sun!
r/gaming,Your mom is amazing!

r/gaming,Wholesome mom u hve there
r/gaming,Awesone work!  Elite Knight is probably one of my favorite sets of armor as far as aesthetics are concerned.
r/gaming,Up voting for motherly love
r/gaming,"I know probably nobody cares, but the fact that you are sharing this hobby of yours with your mom kinda makes me really happy. :) 

I imagine the car ride there and you two discussing poses, lightning, hell even the lore of darksouks and it's wholesome."

r/gaming,Damn. Amazing.
r/gaming,"Fucking hell, man! That is incredible. Do you have any more pictures?"

r/gaming,That‚Äôs freakin awesome!!!
r/gaming,Amazing!
r/gaming,"At first glance I thought this was a character in game, way to go!"
r/gaming,"Amazing...my favorite armor set of any game hands down. Keep it up!

Edit: Took a second look at the pic, wow. Brilliant photo effect, it really makes the fine details of the armor stand out, and the pose really makes it feel ""souls-y"""
r/gaming,Reminds of goblin slayer
r/gaming,Have any pictures that actually show the rest of it?
r/gaming,Mommy loves me!
r/gaming,You have a big head
r/gaming,/r/mallninjashit
r/gaming,I sure do remember Christian 4. of Denmark wielding that in the 30 years war.
r/gaming,Hello Halo
r/gaming,"Ah yes, an authentic replica of the energy sword, as originally seen in the classic ye old renaissance-era tale of *Halo*."
r/gaming,Looks like it's perfect for circumcising potential attackers
r/gaming,Need alien hands to properly wield that thing.
r/gaming,Carful it does is sharp
r/gaming,Stabby stabby
r/gaming,Ah I remember chain killing the fuck out of people with that back in the day. Great times.
r/gaming,"Ye Olde... Just buy it or don't, okay? Turkey legs are around the corner."
r/gaming,"Damnnn, wanna give it to ya boi.

But seriously, looks awesome! Whoever at the festival gave that to you did an awesome job"
r/gaming,"At least its not a fighter jet. I mean, what's so hard about swish, swish, stab?"
r/gaming,Just keep it away from Butters.
r/gaming,ARGGGHHHHGGGRRRRRRGHHH
r/gaming,Awesome!
r/gaming,"Ah yes, the xbox renaissance."
r/gaming,Walk around with that thing and nobody‚Äôs gonna mess with you
r/gaming,I dont think that belonged there
r/gaming,"Wait, that's illegal"
r/gaming,"If you are going to play the original version, you should try some mods that'll give a lot of 'quality of life' enhancements like wide screen. Prob the best, most comprehensive mod is the Tutu mod that essentially runs BG1 in the BG2 engine. That means you'll get things like gem bags, BG2 classes, etc. It's a bit of a ball-ache to install but it's worth it for the improvements.

r/gaming,My first dnd experience on the pc...
r/gaming,Go for the eyes Boo!  GO FOR THE EYES!!  *RAAASK!!!*
r/gaming,FYI the enhanced edition is really good
r/gaming,"I just finished it again recently, it's still great! I'm replaying Icewind Dale now, and I actually prefer that one as I'm more into hack n slash versus lots of dialogue (though I do love me some Minsc)."
r/gaming,You must gather your party before venturing forth...
r/gaming,"Nice. My favorite game in the world. Watch out, those discs can fall out of that case easily... happened to me :("
r/gaming,Ah yes the 6cd portfolio. Did you get the map as well? These are all on GoG for anyone interested
r/gaming,It's great. Played through 16 times when I was young.
r/gaming,It's on mobile as well! The first and second.
r/gaming,"bruh, literally?"
r/gaming,I serve the Flaming Fist!
r/gaming,"Heya! It's me, Imoen."
r/gaming,Best. Game. Evar.
r/gaming,"Ah yes, that age old figure of speech that goes: ""I found Baldur's Gate in an antique mall."""
r/gaming,How are you playing it? Did you setup a VM?
r/gaming,RIP BioWare
r/gaming,"God I hated that there were *5* cd's to install this damn game. Having to change out discs all the time because you were loading to a new area. Finally one of my discs became unreadable and I wasn't able to finish the game.... Until reading the manual I saw you could send in all your discs and for like 5 or 10 dollars they'd send back a DVD! Hopefully you were able to pick up the expansions for it too, lots of fun there."
r/gaming,As opposed to figuratively finding it at an antique mall.
r/gaming,"Was playing baldur's gate dark alliance on co-op story on the ps2 with my gf. Such nostalgic fun, still a great game!"
r/gaming,It's also on Steam.
r/gaming,"Ok load up apple emulator and kick out Wizardy: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord

Come back and see me after AndreW blasts you with a couple LaHalitos."
r/gaming,"S: ""You're perceptive for an old man. You know why I'm here, hand over your ward and no-one will be hurt. If you resist it shall be a waste of your life.""

r/gaming,Are PC 2's backwards compatible?
r/gaming,"My golden strategy: walk into inn, steal something, wait for guard to show, kill HIM, take all his sweet gear, set out and avoid magic peeps."
r/gaming,"Enhanced edition on steam, and IOS app store. I love em, I was on a bit of a isometric rpg kick recently."
r/gaming,I think I read an article last week that said they are porting it into PS4 as well.
r/gaming,Thanks for pointing out that you didn't figuratively find the game in an antique mall
r/gaming,"Go for the eyes, Boo!  Go for the eyes!"
r/gaming,Gorion would be proud of your actions!
r/gaming,You literally found it?
r/gaming,You literally found it
r/gaming,The lord of mmurrderrrr shall Perish and in his passing he shall spawn a score of mortal proGeny. So  sayth the Wissseeeee Allllannndooooo
r/gaming,"How would you ""figuratively"" find a game?"
r/gaming,There's some great enhancements anf mods out there to patch in removed content and some QoL fixes as well - don't forget to have silver or +5 equipment for the expax üòä
r/gaming,Baldur‚Äôs Gate Dark Alliance 1 &amp; 2 on PS2 were the best co-op campaigns on PS2. Change my mind.
r/gaming,"The true dnd experience, so damn brutal...

Hiya!"
r/gaming,"I think I've bought BG 4 times over the years.

How many times did you reroll to get the best scores possible?"
r/gaming,"This and Icewind Dale. The nostalgia feels. I love the manuals that came with them, so detailed."
r/gaming,Loved that game but would pay modern pricing tho play So you want to be a Hero agsin.
r/gaming,Haha I still have my copy does it work on win 10?
r/gaming,Got this on Steam. For anyone that has no old computer...
r/gaming,And it will be more enjoyable than 99.9% of the steaming hot dumpster jizz that so called AAA developers are putting out today.
r/gaming,"Mmm, those classic triple install bars."
r/gaming,You LITERALLY found it? Oh my God. I am LITERALLY amazed that you LITERALLY found it.
r/gaming,Literally
r/gaming,YOU MUST GATHER YOUR PARTY BEFORE VENTURING FORTH
r/gaming,I remember having that game. Never got past like the first 2 hours.
r/gaming,It‚Äôs been remastered and on steam for a while now
r/gaming,My childhood just hit me in the face
r/gaming,Will the disks even work on new operating systems? I had issues back in the day moving from windows XP to 7 and not being able to play older games.
r/gaming,Prefer Saturday
r/gaming,"I still have my copy, the expansion, and the sequel. Great game!"
r/gaming,I haven‚Äôt seen that install screen in a long time.
r/gaming,"Played it through last year, game play is classic!"
r/gaming,I think i threw out my original discs not too long ago...dont think i had them all anymore anyway.
r/gaming,I played this with my dad
r/gaming,!remindme 20yrs
r/gaming,It‚Äôs on steam btw
r/gaming,I loved that game
r/gaming,"Why did I read that as ""*Bladders Gate*""?"
r/gaming,"Played the original and the Tutu version - I advise the Tutu version.

Make sure you patch it here: http://sorcerers.net/Games/BG/index_misc.php"
r/gaming,I recognize that installer from Sonic CD! It was on Windows 95.
r/gaming,Insert disc 4.
r/gaming,I'm playing multiplayer with one of my best friends. This game is a treasure.
r/gaming,I have tried to start this game on three separate occasions and just can‚Äôt get into it. I like CRPGs so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me.
r/gaming,It was on steam sale last week and I‚Äôm so happy I picked it up as well :)
r/gaming,I had II
r/gaming,I used to play the shot out of this!!
r/gaming,I have mine in a records box in the basement.  :)
r/gaming,10/10. You could just get the enhanced edition online though. I have it on my laptop. Only game I have lol.
r/gaming,I miss that game.
r/gaming,"awesome....loved BG2 as well, fuck im old"
r/gaming,Do yah wanna tell me a story about the trollope and the plug tail..... PLEASEEEEEE?
r/gaming,Did you find the laptop there too?
r/gaming,Your voice is ambrosia!
r/gaming,That rings never going to go with her outfit
r/gaming,Since no one seems to have said it.... This is coming to Switch soon.
r/gaming,"Enjoy!  
I recommend enhanced edition. Lots of little QOL improvements."
r/gaming,Nice! The only one I've played so far is Dark Alliance for the GameCube
r/gaming,Anyone played Planescape on the iPhone XS Max ?  Is it playable ?  Worth getting ?
r/gaming,"Get the enhanced edition. It was on sale last I checked, and definitely worth the QoL upgrades"
r/gaming,"[It's also on steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/228280/Baldurs_Gate_Enhanced_Edition/)... but you probably found it for a cheaper price. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Though you might not have the extra content since that looks like the original instead of the enhanced edition."
r/gaming,I have that same computer that I use for school!
r/gaming,Bard the hell out of that shit
r/gaming,You made me hear main menu theme music
r/gaming,You can get it on your phone now
r/gaming,actually a good game
r/gaming,I‚Äôm so jealous...  might dig up my Icewind Dale 2 cds.
r/gaming,As someone who replays this every couple years. You won‚Äôt be disappointed! Have a great adventure!
r/gaming,"Jokes on you, i have the game on steam. Before realising that the game i wanted was dungeon siege. I remembered two weeks later after thinking why it wasnt how i remember it. Old games plus bad memory dont work well together."
r/gaming,"If you like Baldur's gate, you want to check pillars of eternity !"
r/gaming,I just found CDs of Diablo 1 and 2 at a garage sale earlier this week. I bought them both for a dollar!
r/gaming,"That game is stupid hard, good luck"
r/gaming,Sounds like the begginig of an horror movie.
r/gaming,"Oooh, that's a good one."
r/gaming,When it first came out it was amazing... trying to play it now however dont quite have the same wow factor... plus you can get an enhanced verion on your mobile now. i got to meet Drizzt which was the best thing for me.
r/gaming,That giant Cd wallet brings back some memories (still have mine). I remember getting BG some time after my complementary 30 days of UO had expired. I wa so excited I probably read the manual 3 times in the time it took us to get home from the mall.
r/gaming,It's available on phone for like 3 bucks.
r/gaming,"Nice man, awesome find!"
r/gaming,I highly recommend getting the updated versions on steam - they fix alot of the problems and bugs and improve quality of life. Also of course mod compatible...
r/gaming,"That installer is ubiquitous on games from that era. IIRC, many publishers used that very same installer because it was so lightweight and performed remarkably well on the majority of systems."
r/gaming,That instal bar brings back shitload of memories.
r/gaming,The nostalgia in this post is strong.
r/gaming,I read an article about a rumor of old games like this coming to the switch. Dunno if there is any truth behind it but I hope so
r/gaming,"OMG the Barbarian with that ultimate sword you find in the last cave of the main storyline quest - duplicate the sword with the item drop trick and equip two, one in each hand - then craft them up the wazoo, use rage and run through new game+ like the Tasmanian devil.

r/gaming,Did you gather your party before venturing forth?
r/gaming,This post seems like the beginning to a horror movie.
r/gaming,How will you play it. Are their emulators of earlier operating systems or do you just have a retro pc with an earlier os installed?
r/gaming,Oh the nostalgia of that fucking construction site
r/gaming,This game was so infuriating. I miss it so much.

r/gaming,Him screaming whoa as he falls is just burned into my mind

r/gaming,-laughs in Lion King/Aladdin/Jungle book for the SNES-
r/gaming,Kh3 looking pretty good
r/gaming,What is the name of the game?
r/gaming,People had trouble with this tree? My favorite levels were the construction zone an this level.
r/gaming,ALL Toy Story games were rage inducing in my experience.
r/gaming,"I completely forgot about this game! Infuriating as all hell, child me misses it!"
r/gaming,The fucking memories of this game though. The music still haunts me
r/gaming,This whole game still haunts me and the OG Toy Story game too. For a game attended for kids they made it so difficult
r/gaming,Did you slide down it in gym class and bust a nut?
r/gaming,"The Toy Store though, or was that the second game?"
r/gaming,Ah man games I wanna pick up for my N64.
r/gaming,Apparently if you slide down this fast enough you‚Äôll bust a nut.
r/gaming,My childhood in a nutshell. Hours spent crying over this goddamn tree.
r/gaming,Toy story 3 for Xbox 360 gives nightmares
r/gaming,zerg kite
r/gaming,"I actually place this game at least once a year.  It still holds up, and is a wave of nostalgia. It's still super fun and the music never gets old."
r/gaming,I loved this game. Played it for years before I made it past the 2nd or 3rd level. So difficult.
r/gaming,"I played ps1 back in the day, now I smash the game on vita."
r/gaming,I see this and I raise you God of War 1's climbing out of hell area
r/gaming,Omg I can still hear it
r/gaming,Man I loved this game.
r/gaming,I used to play that! Haven‚Äôt thought of this game for like 20 years wow! Thanks
r/gaming,Oh my god the memories you just brought back
r/gaming,I knew this wasn‚Äôt a fever dream I had once
r/gaming,FUCK THIS GAME SO MUCH AHHHHHH
r/gaming,Omg I loved this game but it was so difficult!
r/gaming,"Never played the game, but I get this. Ow"
r/gaming,Can‚Äôt believe I used to play this as a kid
r/gaming,Fuck you so much for reminding me of that goddamn tree!!!!
r/gaming,holy shit...
r/gaming,Trying to get those army guys out of the mole holes while the demon lawnmower chased me around caused nightmares for my little 10 yr old self.
r/gaming,This and the construction site were my nightmare as a kid.
r/gaming,The sweet feeling when you finally reach the top... Only to slip like a dumbass and fall to your death. I love that game.
r/gaming,Wow.....war flashbacks to watching my boyfriend Any% Speed Run this on twitch
r/gaming,Can we please get this game on steam?
r/gaming,About a year ago I picked this game up to play it again. Everything was great until I got to this part.  This fucking part. I don‚Äôt know how many times I fell from the tree until I rage quit. I haven‚Äôt played it since.
r/gaming,7 yo Kid fucks rope n cums
r/gaming,The horror.... the horror....
r/gaming,This game sparked my frustration at an early age.
r/gaming,"Don't remind me of the zip-line.

My brother had weird nightmares about that level for MONTHS."
r/gaming,Hard to believe I was 6 years old when I played this game. Brings back good memories
r/gaming,These graphics remind me of a Rugrats game I used to play lol
r/gaming,Can someone explain (never heard of or played this game)
r/gaming,"If you have a  PS3, you can buy this as a PS1 classic for $10. It's definitely worth it! I recently just finished playing this again and it's just as infuriating as an adult as a kid lol"
r/gaming,Can we talk about the fact that Andy‚Äôs basement was just covered in acid? I‚Äôm sure if they released a new game we‚Äôd find the acid in Andy‚Äôs room instead üòâ
r/gaming,"This and *Simpsons Hit &amp; Run* get hella exposure on this sub, deservedly so; I guess they're not as underrated as I thought."
r/gaming,"I played this whole game hoping id get to play as Zurg or unlock him somehow after beating the game. It was a complete chore too, all i wanted to do was shoot Zurgs gun. I thought he was the coolest character in the story and I still do. Ahhh man I was so disappointed when I didn't get to play as him."

r/gaming,"I still have my copy of this game for playstation.
Also Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time was amazing, still have that too."
r/gaming,Holy balls. Never in my life did I think anyone else played this game. Guess I was very wrong!
r/gaming,"That game is still one of my favourites from the psone. That backyard level is great, but the tree... fucking hell the tree."
r/gaming,"I would love to see this game remade in unreal engine 4, would probably look very similar to the movie."
r/gaming,"Tree was cake compared to the Construction Site, and climbing the fire escapes in Alleys and Gulleys"
r/gaming,I was today years old when I remembered playing this game as a child.
r/gaming,Holy crap! Other people really played this? One of my favorite games of all time! Had it on N64. Love the toy store level

r/gaming,"No sir, you invested in that 3 years ago."
r/gaming,Nice. Have you ever updated it with newer emulators and/or roms?
r/gaming,I remember Cadillacs and Dinosaurs!!! That game gobbled up  so many coins.
r/gaming,Looks awesome!
r/gaming,"Should have moved the painting behind it in 3 years, buddy! Nonetheless, awesome."
r/gaming,That‚Äôs awesome I really want an arcade system but they are expensive
r/gaming,Nice
r/gaming,That's an easy Matchup for Iori Yagami
r/gaming,I made mine using a old neo geo cabinet and a raspberry pi it has 18k games one its awesome
r/gaming,Now all of China knows you‚Äôre here
r/gaming,"It's simple - steam uses username separate from email, epic don't. So if your email got leaked somewhere else, script kiddies will attempt to use it to log into your account. Not a design flaw per se, but clearly an inferior option for logins."
r/gaming,"My epic account was compromised. 

I use a password manager and my password was literally a mess of garbage. 

It means either they got compromised or they allow brute forcing. Its ridiculous."
r/gaming,"The hate for the Epic Games Launcher is not just a circlejerk. There are serious issues with it, and this is one of them."
r/gaming,I had an E.G. account from briefly trying Fortnite when it came out. It was locked for failed logon attempts.
r/gaming,"Definitely not the first time I've heard of this. Oddly enough, I haven't had an issue with either Steam or Epic in this manner, but a buddy of mine had his Steam account harassed for a long time. He recovered it once and they still kept trying. Fuck these people. I'm assuming it's due to their weaker security and the crazy popularity of Fortnite?"
r/gaming,I had a hell of a time just trying to uninstall the fucking thing. I had it from a game I tried a few years back and never used it again.  I'm super pissed about these exclusivity things because their launcher is worse than Ubisoft's website.
r/gaming,Looks like the last server I had a public facing RDP gateway set up on. It got 1000‚Äôs of hits an hour.
r/gaming,"When I was in boot camp someone got into my account and messed with all my fortnite shit. (BACK when it was kind of fun) Could not get my account back for awhile bought save the world on my ps4, finally got that account back then realized I didn‚Äôt own save the world on my ps4 it was tied to that account. I get these emails so much. I remember getting the email going ‚ÄúHi Muhammad‚Äù and I‚Äôm like what the..?"
r/gaming,"I just checked, steam don't tell you about failed login attempt even if you leak ur login. Maybe this is reason for ""# attempts to login = 0""?

TIP:  Use 2fa. With google authority my # of attempts to login = 0. Or don't leak ur email"
r/gaming,I can't even change my password because I don't get the email when they say they've sent it smh
r/gaming,"And on top of that (I just checked), if you login via another account, like XBox Live, *the 2FA does not ever trigger*. You will never be asked the 2FA code if you login via XBL account. I don't know about the others."
r/gaming,I've deleted my epic account due to all these annoying emails about someone else is trying to login.
r/gaming,"Six months for a shopping cart

S I X  M O N T H S"
r/gaming,Never Epic Game. If they start with exclusives from begin is not because they care bout you and want to compete with Steam. If they go with such scummy tactic from the start you never know how they gonna squeeze you later when they get a hold on big enough player base.
r/gaming,"I really wanted to use Epic for the Satisfactory beta. Like, I'm cool waiting for Borderlands 3 and I pre-ordered Anno 1800 before Ubisoft pulled it from Steam. I'm burned out on Ubisoft shenanigans between them constantly trying to find the line between player retention and being just like Papa EA and Anno 2205 sucking so much sweaty taint. I would have taken a hard pass at Anno 1800. But, I really, really, really, want to play ~~Goat factory~~ Satisfactory.

Created an Epic account, logged in, went to the store. Couldn't complete the purchase. Deleted that hot shit off my computer and will now wait for Satisfactory. GOG is competition to Steam. Origin is hot EA garbage. Epic is just, I'm not even sure how to explain it... Seems like it's ran by the eight year olds that steal their parents credit cards to buy fortnite dances. Or like the guy that drives daddy's C5 Corvette to the high end car meet and proceeds to talk shit on everyone there. Epic just ain't right and I feel like the only exclusive they deserve is Diablo ~~mobile~~ immortal."
r/gaming,Same. I‚Äôve gotten so many attempt emails from epic. Have the most basic basic 15 year old password for steam. Never
r/gaming,I‚Äôm pretty sure no one said that considering the majority of users actually think the EGL is pretty terrible.
r/gaming,But Exclusivity! and Money! Did I say Money yet?
r/gaming,Yup. Epic Launcher's security is extremely lackluster.
r/gaming,"TENCENT GAMING

&amp;#x200B;

BIG LUL"
r/gaming,All around the w-w-w-world... people want your passwooord
r/gaming,"Former Fortnite support agent here, we used to get cases of people getting their accounts stolen on a daily basis. And even on unrelated cases once you check the account of the player, 9 times out of 10 you'll find suspicious logins and activity. 

Stay as far away from the Epic launcher as you can, they even have bots auto creating accounts using email addresses of people they get from some kind of database, and people using other people's emails on a daily basis. 

It's all sorts of messed up, 0 communication, we're told to stay silent over this and not even inform the player of the activity going on on his account, refunds are denied because they're ""not suspicious"" enough. 

Fuck, I'm glad I quit that job."
r/gaming,"They don't use any kind of authentication for MAKING accounts. I never made an account, but I got an email from Epic. Turns out somebody made an account using my email address. They don't require that you verify that you actually own the address. Classy."
r/gaming,"I don't bother installing it.

Any games exclusive to that store may as well not exist that way."
r/gaming,"I had an Epic account for Paragon. 

Somebody still tries to log into it to this day."
r/gaming,Just what we needed! Another reason not to use the ‚ÄúEpic‚Äù launcher.
r/gaming,They actually said don't use the Epic Games launcher. You must've misheard.
r/gaming,This right here is exactly why I will never use the Epic Games Launcher.   Couple of years ago I downloaded it to see what all the fuss was about over Fortnite.  To this day I keep getting password reset instructions and notifications about my acct being locked.  Thankfully since Fortnite was free I never had any of my credit card information saved on their system and never will.
r/gaming,"Sorry Epic, I am exclusive with launchers that do not annoy me."
r/gaming,"When EPIC stops paying to force consumer to use the epic store, noone will shop there. There is no reason what so ever to go there voluntarily. It's a steaming pile of garbage."
r/gaming,So Tim Sweeney is a liar? You don't say...
r/gaming,"At the time I created an account I had never played/used Fortnite or Epic Games store, but wanted to give Fortnite a try because of how insanely it blew up and how popular it still is. Spoiler: I didn't last very long, not my style of game. Cool. Whatever, uninstall, forget about it. 

Except every 3 days after I created that account, I got emails saying that people were trying to bust into my account. A literal brand new account that would take you less time making than to actually pry yourself into it... I honestly didn't think their security was that bad and had a conspiracy theory that they were sending me these emails to try and fish me back into playing their game."
r/gaming,"Please see https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-account-security for the state of Epic Games account security. This account system has never been compromised, but like other widely-used services is commonly targeted by hackers using known email addresses and passwords leaked from third-party sites that have been compromised.

OP, it looks like you are being targeted this way, and the 2FA checks are successfully protecting your account.

Epic‚Äôs approach has been to send users emails reporting questionable login attempts, while many other sites silently ignore them."
r/gaming,I get so much email spam and account locks on my Epic account.....I never use it because of that problem
r/pics,"This was taken in Austin, Texas during the storm last Wednesday. Took four of my favorite exposures and merged them.

Too bad there isn't a domesticated dog carrying a dead cat like this to feed it's puppies so I can call it nature and see what others think about. I'm sure this will be downvoted to oblivion but it just shows how screwed up people are, thinking domestic cats belong in nature killing wild creatures."
r/pics,All of these cats are probably dead by now.
r/pics,"What a good mom, I'm so proud of her!"
r/pics,"please take those kittens (and their mother, if possible) to be spayed/neutered) asap. you might as well be showing us some street rats or pigeons being cute with their offspring."

r/pics,Def my ex
r/pics,That‚Äôs crystal clear heart. Ex heart is black as tar.

r/pics,"You ok OP?

Anything you want to share?"

2) Is that syrup making the face, and why is it so dark?"
r/pics,Thanks all. My 6-year-old grandson loved it!
r/pics,"I love this, very creative üëç"
r/pics,someone's getting a #1 Grandpa mug for Christmas soon
r/pics,What were you planning to do for breakfast before he asked this? Were waffles on the menu anyway?
r/pics,Good enough to earn my upvote:)
r/pics,"üç¥make one more, I'm stopping by :)"
r/pics,that max waffle is missing the teeth and the luger
r/pics,You knocked it out of the park for having that sprung on you last minute. Good job!

r/pics,"I just saw you in Detroit and as you walked by, I thought to myself, ‚ÄúI think those are the pilots from Reddit.‚Äù"
r/pics,"Remember:

It isn‚Äôt called a cockpit on an all female flight.

It‚Äôs called a box office."
r/pics,"So with [7%](https://centreforaviation.com/analysis/reports/women-airline-pilots-a-tiny-percentage-and-only-growing-slowly-432247) of airline pilots being women, and [75.6%](https://datausa.io/profile/soc/532031/) of flight attendants being women, the chance that any random flight (2 pilots, 4 crew) is ""unmanned"" should be  
0.07x0.07x0.756x0.756x0.756x0.756 = 0.00160060165 = **0.16%**, right?  

a all-male crew should then be  
0.93x0.93x0.244x0.244x0.244x0.244 = 0.00306566857 = 0.31%  

only double the chance. And it flips with the 5th flight attendant (0.075% all male, 0.12% all female)"
r/pics,"I was really confused at first cause I was like, ""No, there are definitely crew on that flight."" And then I realized what you actually meant."
r/pics,With Anna Kendrick as the copilot everything should go pitch perfect
r/pics,Are there really only four flight attendants on an A320?
r/pics,"I got legitimately confused wondering why you'd need pilots on the plane for an unmanned flight

I am not a smart person"
r/pics,Shirley you can't be serious.
r/pics,_sort by controversial_
r/pics,"This post made me think of the song '[Me and the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQVrbzBv-AU)' from Come From Away:

""Suddenly I've got an all female crew/ The news talked, it made headlines across the world/Suddenly it stopped/No one saying, ""You can't"" or ""You won't"" or ""You know you're not anything 'cause you're a girl""

&amp;#x200B;

Sidenote: This is such a good pump up song if you ignore the last minute. Seriously, stop at 3:42 if you don't want to be sad."
r/pics,"I just realized I'm old. I was looking at this picture and was looking for the mom. ""Where is she? I don't see any mom's. These are all girls, where's the old lady?"""
r/pics,Well this thread is bound to be interesting.
r/pics,"This is so cool, your mom is badass."

r/pics,Don't let r/pics become Facebook level trash
r/pics,Yeah keep us posted. What did you two have for breakfast today btw? Photos.

r/pics,Why the fake Supreme jacket lmao
r/pics,Hilarious how many people are butthurt over this post while a pic of a bus with the number 420 on it has 60k+ upvotes.
r/pics,Update!!! I still don't care and this isn't Facebook
r/pics,I'm sorry :/
r/pics,I care enough to say its usually one of us (black men) with a fat white woman. This looks like a great cosplay of Road Trip.

r/pics,Dont do it. Thank me later.

r/pics,"Heck yeah! I just saw your first thread with the ring and meandered over to check your profile only to find this happy news!! 

Huge congratulations to you both. My now-husband also proposed by the sea and said that his biggest source of anxiety was not that I‚Äôd say no, but that we would somehow do a Titanic and drop the ring into the sea where it would be lost for 84 years; so extra congrats on keeping that shit land-locked."

r/pics,"Best $100 I spent for two beers and a chicken sandwich, including the ride up. The view was worth it."
r/pics,"Pro tip. The roof pool is only for guests staying in the premium rooms, which are more expensive. We stayed in a budget room for a few days and switched to the premium for a night to get pool access. Much cheaper and you get the full experience. Avoid racing season."
r/pics,NOPE
r/pics,"You can go up to the bar for free, and as mentioned enjoy the freshest of 30$ beers.   As cool as people think this is, the better spot is 1Altitude across the bay. 
And less crazy rich mainland Chinese."
r/pics,Sort of freaks me out.
r/pics,"Holy cantilever, Batman!"
r/pics,This picture causes anxiety to me.
r/pics,Ill-advised for those who suffer from vertigo.
r/pics,This hotel is on my bucket list
r/pics,"I visited it at night, the views were stunning."
r/pics,Such a cool spot. the entire facility feels like a space station.
r/pics,How'd you get this shot?
r/pics,Reminds me of the seven star hotel in Tropico 4.
r/pics,This was the end destination for a BBC program which recently aired. Such a fantastic show and a beautiful finish line.
r/pics,"I don't mind heights, but the picture angle is giving me vertigo"
r/pics,"I saw this building in the background of the photos for my companies office over there. I honestly thought google had messed up when I first saw it (being we used google streetview pics,) now I know it is real and it is scary huge and really impressive."
r/pics,It looks like someone desperately needed to put a piece of plywood somewhere and needed about 20 seconds of space and used a broken fence on the sidewalk to lay it on.
r/pics,More like a nope top bar :|
r/pics,Nope!
r/pics,I just watched Crazy Rich Asians yesterday.
r/pics,I like that they have some seriously beefy guardrails/glass barriers... they know how Asians like to get around high places. üò¨üò¨
r/pics,"That's a brilliant idea and it shows how the volunteers of the Humane Society really care.

Edit: or employees*"
r/pics,If I tried to draw that dog nobody would ever adopt him
r/pics,This makes me giddy
r/pics,I did some internet stalking of the artist and found out that this handsome pup is still available for adoption at the New Hampshire Humane Society. He is their featured pet and has been waiting since Dec 2018 for a forever home.
r/pics,That dog looks so much happier in the pic than in real life. It is probably a picture to show you what the dog will look like if you choose him.
r/pics,"My cat came with several trading cards, ornaments, and an Obvious Plant sardonic note. They had been trying to get him a home for several years and had accumulated a ton of stuff, which is what they gave to us. I would've loved a drawing!"
r/pics,Any info about the dog?
r/pics,Awe I'd get the dog just for the art.. see this is why I want 10 acres haha.
r/pics,"how about they charge 20-50 bucks for the picture, half goes to the artist the other half goes to the humane society that way the artist can continue to make their art and get animals rescued, people would pay money for this great art especially when its their new baby"
r/pics,I love this!! I wish I was talented enough to do this for my local humane society!
r/pics,"Ahh poor American bulldog, got one of these guys they have giant hearts. Left form3 days for a job and he guarded downstairs non stop, wife is also pregnant so i think he is pulling double duty."
r/pics,This is so cute !
r/pics, Love this but my heart breaks thinking of the art sitting there after one of the animals doesn‚Äôt get adopted
r/pics,"Mine had a volunteer who did excellent pencil sketches. The dog I adopted had been there over 6+mo with a couple others from a puppymill raid, I didn't know till they gave me his binder of medial records that I also got a sketch of the 3 boys together."
r/pics,Really cool idea!
r/pics,r/HumansBeingBros
r/pics,A kind of beautiful idea can only comes from love.
r/pics,Someone adopt that waggy boi!
r/pics,Great idea!
r/pics,F@&amp;$ing Eagleton.
r/pics,My aunt does something similar for a shelter in Arkansas. She is a photographer and she takes photos of dogs up for adoption in costumes. Her work is amazing! You can even purchase merchandise featuring the dogs and the money goes to support the shelter.  [https://www.tammyswarek.com/shelter-pets-project](https://www.tammyswarek.com/shelter-pets-project)
r/pics,"Couldn‚Äôt love this more. Well, maybe if it was cats."
r/pics,I would legit do this for an animal shelter around my area.
r/pics,"This reminds me of Taylormoodyillustration on instagram, she does the same thing."
r/pics,Boof
r/pics,love this
r/pics,I want to pay for someone to draw my dogs
r/pics,what if they adopt the dgo for the are and then abandon them big oof
r/pics,That is a phenomenal idea
r/pics,"I've got a family friend who does this for not only shelters, but also on local wine bottles aswell."
r/pics,Genius!
r/pics,"Man, I would‚Äôve loved a picture of my little lady when I adopted her. She looks ridiculously adorable with her ears up and when they‚Äôre pulled back she looks like a brindle-back version of Dobby."
r/pics,"This just made my day. Thank you, thoughtful humans."
r/pics,Great idea!
r/pics,Theey might wanna just start making prints for the chihuahuas.
r/pics,"Step 1 - adopt dog

Step 2 - return dog, keep painting

Step 3 - ????

Step 4 - Profit"
r/pics,"Now that‚Äôs really cool, and such an amazing idea to have animals adopted.... love it!"
r/pics,So cool!
r/pics,The kill-rate at my local shelter here outside Atlanta is around 70%. I don't think that's unusual. Too many people don't spay or neuter their dogs.
r/pics,"This is awesome, and a great way for artistic folks to help shelters in general, I hope this becomes a trend."
r/pics,Should have drawn him mauling a toddler.

r/pics,What if I just wanna take home the art?

r/pics,"Any sane person wouldn't adopt that breed.

Heeere come the pit apologists. Wah-wah they bully our breed! This is racism! Nanny dogs!"
r/pics,Love this!!!
r/pics,The worst thing ever must be having to take the painting off the cage and hanging it on the wall
r/pics,"*Drawn by Tess Roever. 
Appropriate artist name."
r/pics,Somewhere there are some of these pictures for dogs that were put down.
r/pics,Gorgeous click
r/pics,That is really quite awesome!
r/pics,Draw all the cute little Pictures you want but no way in hell am i taking one of those Dogs Home.  Damn Bipolar Dogs.
r/pics,"The picture looks like a cute nice friendly dog, whilst the caged beast looks like your kids would survive about 10 seconds alone with it :/"
r/pics,Adorbs.  I want a picture of my fuzzy buds!
r/pics,"This is cool and all, but I recently looked into getting a dog from the Humane Society and they wanted $350. 

I get they need to cover neutering/chipping, but this just struck me as really high, and would discourage many from choosing a rescue over some random cheaper options.

Anyway, drawings are cool but personally I just want to save dogs &amp; hope they are spending resources to maximize that end (maybe the drawings help get ‚Äòem adopted faster, who knows)."
r/pics,if they put the money into feeding and shelter instead of snowflake drawings ... maybe they could afford to keep them alive another few days

r/pics,"In case you want to visit, this is Sagalassos in the Burdur region of Turkey (approx. 30Km from the town of Burdur).

Most of the city was flattened by an earthquake back around 600AD but, since 1990 Belgium archaeologists helped by local labour and skilled stonemasons have been excavating and rebuilding.

The pictured fountain is a perfect example of the brilliant reconstruction. There are also very handy colour coded information boards showing; stones still in place, stones which needed to be re-positioned and stones that have been replaced.

If you look at the top of the left column you will see that part of the capital (ornate bit at the top) has been remade and on the right column both the base and capital are new.

I can‚Äôt remember what the entrance fee was exactly, somewhere between 1 &amp; 2 Euro so an absolute bargain.

It is well off the beaten track and so unlike most of the other Roman sites, there are hardly any tourists. When we visited in Aug 2018, staying for around 3 hours, there were only around 10 or so other visitors the whole time. 

As it is out of the way, you probably need a car to visit but, don‚Äôt let that put you off as, driving in Turkey (apart from major cities like Istanbul) is really easy with great roads and little traffic.

&gt; Researchers Use Gene Editing with CRISPR to Treat Lethal Lung Diseases before Birth


&gt; Using CRISPR gene editing, a team from Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Penn Medicine have thwarted a lethal lung disease in an animal model in which a harmful mutation causes death within hours after birth. This proof-of-concept study, published today in Science Translational Medicine, showed that in utero editing could be a promising new approach for treating lung diseases before birth.

In utero gene editing for monogenic lung disease.

Editing out a lethal lung disease

Surfactant, a lipoprotein mixture that reduces lung surface tension, is essential for normal lung function. In rare cases, infants are born with genetic surfactant deficiency, resulting in rapid death from respiratory failure. Because of the immediate perinatal fatality associated with this disease, any effective intervention would need to be applied before delivery. Alapati et al. used a mouse model of genetic surfactant deficiency to demonstrate the feasibility of in utero gene editing to delete the mutant allele. The authors showed that correction of the genetic defect before birth improved lung development and survival in the treated animals, demonstrating the feasibility of this therapeutic intervention.

Abstract

Monogenic lung diseases that are caused by mutations in surfactant genes of the pulmonary epithelium are marked by perinatal lethal respiratory failure or chronic diffuse parenchymal lung disease with few therapeutic options. Using a CRISPR fluorescent reporter system, we demonstrate that precisely timed in utero intra-amniotic delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing reagents during fetal development results in targeted and specific gene editing in fetal lungs. Pulmonary epithelial cells are predominantly targeted in this approach, with alveolar type 1, alveolar type 2, and airway secretory cells exhibiting high and persistent gene editing. We then used this in utero technique to evaluate a therapeutic approach to reduce the severity of the lethal interstitial lung disease observed in a mouse model of the human SFTPCI73T mutation. Embryonic expression of SftpcI73T alleles is characterized by severe diffuse parenchymal lung damage and rapid demise of mutant mice at birth. After in utero CRISPR-Cas9‚Äìmediated inactivation of the mutant SftpcI73T gene, fetuses and postnatal mice showed improved lung morphology and increased survival. These proof-of-concept studies demonstrate that in utero gene editing is a promising approach for treatment and rescue of monogenic lung diseases that are lethal at birth."
r/science,"Is it removed from the genes entirely?  Or just from the affected tissue?

Like, if this disease is hereditary, would this animal pass on the disease to offspring or would they also benefit from the changes?"
r/science,"while this definitely are good news, the last time i heard about CRISPR people said, it wasnt precise enough to not damage other genes or is this kind of problem under control?"

At first the unknowing person was confused &amp; just sat there. Eventually, though, the social pressure to do what everyone else is doing takes over &amp; the person also starts repeating the behaviors. Then another unknowing person is added to the situation &amp; they start doing it too."

r/science,Does this have to do with general exercise and light concentration on the physical activity versus a more sedentary activity level with minimal to no concentration required?

Key Points

Question  Is light-intensity physical activity associated with brain volume?

Findings  In this community-based cohort study of 2354 participants, each additional hour spent in light-intensity physical activity was associated with larger brain volume, equivalent to approximately 1.1 years less brain aging. Achieving 10‚ÄØ000 or more steps per day was associated with higher brain volume compared with those achieving fewer than 5000 steps per day.

Meaning  Incremental physical activity, even at a more practical light intensity, may be involved in the maintenance of brain structures into older age.

Abstract

Importance  Dementia risk may be attenuated by physical activity (PA); however, the specific activity levels optimal for dementia prevention are unclear. Moreover, most older adults are unable to meet the nationally recommended PA guidelines, set at 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous PA per week.

Objective  To assess the association of total steps walked per day and total dose (intensity‚Äâ√ó‚Äâduration) of PA with brain volumes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among Framingham Heart Study participants.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This cross-sectional, community-based cohort study of the association of accelerometry-determined PA with brain MRI measures in Framingham, Massachusetts, included the Framingham Heart Study third-generation (examination 2, 2008-2011) and offspring (examination 9, 2011-2014) cohorts. Of 4021 participants who agreed to wear an accelerometer and had valid data (‚â•10 hours/day for ‚â•3 days), 1667 participants who did not undergo brain MRI (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1604) or had prevalent dementia or stroke (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ63) were excluded. Data analysis began in 2016 and was completed in February 2019.

Exposures  Physical activity achieved using accelerometry-derived total activity (steps per day) and 2 intensity levels (light intensity and moderate to vigorous intensity).

Main Outcomes and Measures  Differences in total brain volume and other MRI markers of brain aging.

Results  The study sample of 2354 participants had a mean (SD) age of 53 (13) years, 1276 (54.2%) were women, and 1099 (46.7%) met the PA guidelines. Incremental light-intensity PA was associated with higher total brain volume; each additional hour of light-intensity PA was associated with approximately 1.1 years less brain aging (Œ≤ estimate, 0.22; SD, 0.07; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.003). Among individuals not meeting the PA guidelines, each hour of light-intensity PA (Œ≤ estimate, 0.28; SD, 0.11; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.01) and achieving 7500 steps or more per day (Œ≤ estimate, 0.44; SD, 0.18; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.02) were associated with higher total brain volume, equivalent to approximately 1.4 to 2.2 years less brain aging. After adjusting for light-intensity PA, neither increasing moderate to vigorous PA levels nor meeting the threshold moderate to vigorous PA level recommended by the PA guidelines were significantly associated with total brain volume.

Conclusions and Relevance  Every additional hour of light-intensity PA was associated with higher brain volumes, even among individuals not meeting current PA guidelines. These data are consistent with the notion that the potential benefits of PA on brain aging may accrue at a lower, more achievable level of intensity or duration."

&gt;Great white sharks and orcas overlap in their positions on the food chain‚Äîthey can appear in the same places and feed on the same prey. But when they interact, even a short visit from an orca can send the massive sharks scurrying for long periods of time ..
&gt;
&gt;The ranges of the great white sharks and killer whales overlap in the Northern Pacific, especially during the fall and early winter, when they both meet on coastal sites to prey on seals.  There hasn‚Äôt been a lot of study on the direct interactions between these two predators, though orcas do sometimes attack sharks, probably to feed on their nutrient-rich livers, as we‚Äôve previously reported.
&gt;
&gt;There were many examples of orcas spooking the sharks. On November 2, 2009, there were 17 tagged sharks in the waters around the islands. Killer whales showed up for just 2.5 hours and didn‚Äôt kill any of the tagged sharks‚Äîbut the scientists stopped detecting all but one of those sharks in the waters for the rest of the season. Similar shark exoduses occurred in 2011 and 2013.

Abstract

Pornography use, preference for ‚Äúporn‚Äêlike‚Äù sex, masturbation, and sexual and relationship satisfaction were assessed among two samples of men (NStudy 1‚Äâ=‚Äâ326, NStudy 2‚Äâ=‚Äâ335). Frequent pornography use was associated with sexual dissatisfaction, greater preference for porn‚Äêlike sex, and more frequent masturbation in both studies. Pornography use was associated with relationship dissatisfaction in Study 2 only. The data did not support the notion that pornography negatively impacts sexual or relationship satisfaction via preference for porn‚Äêlike sex. In fact, it may bolster sexual satisfaction by promoting sexual variety. The data were consistent with a model in which pornography negatively, indirectly affects sexual and relationship satisfaction via masturbation frequency. Pornography use may have multiple opposing influences on sexual satisfaction."

   &gt; Cannabinoid receptors (CB) regulate thermogenesis, food intake and inflammation. CB1 ablation or inhibition helps reducing body weight and food intake. Stimulation of CB2 limits inflammation and promotes anti-obesity effects by reducing food intake and weight gain. Its genetic ablation results in adiposity development. CB receptors are also responsible for transforming white adipose tissue towards beige or brown adipocytes, therefore their modulation can be considered potential anti-obesity target.

Abstract

Background

Pre-clinical studies indicate increased food intake and weight gain as cannabinoid effects. Cross-sectional epidemiological studies, however, indicate lower prevalence of obesity among cannabis users. Here, we aim to study the weight-gain research question in the prospectively conducted National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC).

Methods

NESARC was designed to produce nationally representative estimates for the US population. Participants (aged 18+) completed computer-assisted personal interviews on cannabis use, body weight and height at Waves 1 (W1, 2001‚Äì02) and 2 (W2, 2004‚Äì05). General linear modelling yields estimates for change in body mass index (BMI) regressed on cannabis-use status, with covariate adjustment based on a conceptual model for BMI determinants (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ33‚Äâ000).

Results

At W2, 77% of the participants never used cannabis, 18% had discontinued use (‚Äòquit‚Äô), 3% were initiates and 2% were persistent users. Estimated W1-to-W2 BMI change shows an increase for all subgroups. Compared with never-users (reference), inverse slope estimates and attenuated change (%) in BMI between W1 and W2 are seen for cannabis-use subgroups: quitters [Œ≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ‚Äì0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI)‚Äâ=‚Äâ‚Äì1.01, ‚Äì0.60], initiates (Œ≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ‚Äì0.97; 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ‚Äì1.36, ‚Äì0.57) and persistent users (Œ≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ‚Äì1.26; 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ‚Äì1.81, ‚Äì0.72).

Conclusion

This new prospective study builds from anecdotes, pre-clinical studies and cross-sectional evidence on inverse associations linking cannabis use and obesity and shows an inverse cannabis‚ÄìBMI increase association. Confirmatory studies with rigorous cannabis and BMI assays will be needed."

There are weird things you never think about as a native English speaker, but which you must consider when writing technical documents that might be read across the globe.  Non-native English speakers have horrible times understanding things like ""I blew up the balloon,"". Did you actually explode the balloon with dynamite or did you *inflate it* with your lungs?  Even native English speakers have trouble with English.  Take for example the word *should*.  The EPA once told a factory something along the lines that they 'should install a screen on their smoke stacks to reduce pollution'.  The only problem is that the world *should* has multiple degrees of meaning: 

https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/should

The company went on to install the screens and found out later that the EPA had no actual authority to require it.  The company interpreted what the EPA wrote as it being 'required'.  The company ended up suing the EPA for hundreds of millions of dollars to recoup the costs and actually won, because the lawyers had a field day with word play when it comes to the use of the word 'should'.  Technical documents have to avoid all sorts of thorny grammatical issues that can lead to different interpretations.

Asian languages are well known for not needing complex grammar and tenses.  If you have 5 apples sitting on the table you know that if you say '5 apple' you mean more than one.  You don't need a S.  In Thai, there aren't even past or future tenses at all!  You know from the context of the sentence of what period of time you are talking about.

**Abstract:**

&gt;**Background**
Most of the previous studies on diet and colorectal cancer were based on diets consumed during the 1990s.

&gt;**Methods**

&gt;We used Cox-regression models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios for colorectal cancer by dietary factors in the UK Biobank study. Men and women aged 40‚Äì69‚Äâyears at recruitment (2006‚Äì10) reported their diet on a short food-frequency questionnaire (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ475 581). Dietary intakes were re-measured in a large sub-sample (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ175‚Äâ402) who completed an online 24-hour dietary assessment during follow-up. Trends in risk across the baseline categories were calculated by assigning re-measured intakes to allow for measurement error and changes in intake over time.

&gt;**Results**

&gt;During an average of 5.7‚Äâyears of follow-up, 2609 cases of colorectal cancer occurred. Participants who reported consuming an average of 76‚Äâg/day of red and processed meat compared with 21‚Äâg/day had a 20% [95% confidence interval (CI): 4‚Äì37] higher risk of colorectal cancer. Participants in the highest fifth of intake of fibre from bread and breakfast cereals had a 14% (95% CI: 2‚Äì24) lower risk of colorectal cancer. Alcohol was associated with an 8% (95% CI: 4‚Äì12) higher risk per 10‚Äâg/day higher intake. Fish, poultry, cheese, fruit, vegetables, tea and coffee were not associated with colorectal-cancer risk.

&gt;**Conclusions**

&gt;Consumption of red and processed meat at an average level of 76 g/d that meets the current UK government recommendation (‚â§90‚Äâg/day) was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Alcohol was also associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, whereas fibre from bread and breakfast cereals was associated with a reduced risk."

&gt;The microbial production of PHA from VFA has been explored using both pure strains and mixed-cultures.(82,83) [...] successfully tested in a 500L pilot-scale for sewage, reaching a PHA content of 0.47 g PHA g‚Äì1 VSS, with COD yields for different wastewater treatment plants ranging from 0.19 to 0.39 g CODPHA g‚Äì1 COD.(4)

&gt;All these results are promising to the point that a 1‚àí3 tonnes pilot plant to be built in the Netherlands was recently announced.(88) However, further work is required to make a commercial PHA route from sewage viable.

1-3 tonnes (I am assuming per day) seems to be laughably small.  What type of scale are we looking at for commercial production here?  Wouldn't scaling bring costs down?  The costs are not that far off of PET (‚Ç¨1400‚Äì1950 tonne^‚Äì1 vs ‚Ç¨1300 tonne^‚Äì1 for PET)."

I was nine years old when the war ended. I remember being a child and watching explosions on TV. I was more scared of suicide bombers and unattended packages in buses than monsters in my closet. I remember what it was like to have half my own country completely inaccessible because if heavy fighting.

I'm too young to remember the real ugliness but this brings so much backs. It's terrifying and I feel powerless, all the more for being so far away and so safe.

The extent of this attack is unprecedented. Totally out of the blue, extremely well coordinated, meticulously planned. This took serious manpower, resources and planning. I cannot think of a single extremist group existing in the country right now  who would be capable of this. Communal violence and religious riots have been problems for years but this is wholesale and organized in a completely different way.

&gt; Israeli soldiers shot on Thursday a restrained Palestinian teenager they had detained for suspected stone-throwing as he was attempting to flee, although he was blindfolded and handcuffed.

&gt; One of the soldiers, an officer, is seen dressing the detainee&amp;#039;s wounds with the help of two Palestinian women while another soldier threatens other Palestinians in the area not to come closer or &amp;quot;They&amp;#039;ll get a bullet, I&amp;#039;m not kidding.&amp;quot; The soldier issuing threats holds a sniper rifle and aims a handgun at a Palestinian man standing near him.

&gt; According to the Israeli army spokesperson: &amp;quot;Disturbances have occurred recently involving Israeli cars on the road near the Arab Tekoa,&amp;quot; referring to the Palestinian village, as opposed to the nearby Israeli settlement of Tekoa.

There was a murder recently by Israeli settlers who claimed a Palestinian tried to stab them - despite multiple witnesses saying he only threw 2-3 small stones. They shot at him from their car and as he lay there wounded, another settler executed him.

Soldiers then tried to cover it up by deleting footage from nearby security cameras.

That's the consequences of trying to run away from the military. What did he think was going to happen?  Just let him walk?

Also, nice editorialization of ""The Palestinians managed to evacuate"" like he's in some sort of active warzone.

1) If he's in an active warzone then who would send a kid there? (Hint: P a l e s t i n i a n s)

2) If he's not in an active warzone then why did he need to be 'evacuated'

So dumb.

r/worldnews,"Interesting standpoint. 

As someone involved in climate science, I find it curious how much single-use plastics get flak. Pound for pound, they are often far and away the most energy efficient to manufacture for their use cases. 

And our species is going to die off because of burning too many fossil fuels for power, not too much plastic in the oceans. All other concerns are secondary beside the energy transition."

&gt; Germany&amp;#039;s conservative candidate for EU parliamentary elections, Manfred Weber, has spoken out in support of a global ban on single-use plastic.

&gt; Weber spoke about his views on plastics and pollution with German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, on Sunday.

&gt; Weber is the current parliamentary leader of the European People&amp;#039;s Party in the EU Parliament and is affiliated with Angela Merkel&amp;#039;s Christian democratic CDU party and its sister Bavarian party CSU. The conservative EU lawmaker has also declared his ambition to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission later this year.

r/worldnews,"Manfred Weber was one of the people in favor of article 13. In fact his party (CDU/CSU) almost exclusively voted for it.

I'm done with these corrupt assholes. Him proposing a ban on single-use plastics is just a desperate attempt to get votes. The ban will come either way in the next few years."
r/worldnews,"Have there been any study of how such a ban would affect green house gas emissions? 

Of the two problems, plastic pollution is the lesser evil. So any single use item where the replacement would lead to a higher carbon footprint would be a bad idea in my book.

Edit: hit save to soon. 

We had a study about the use of plastic grocery bags in Denmark, not long ago. Surprisingly they are the option that have the least environmental footprint assuming that they where used at least twice for grocery shopping. As they are not single use they are not part of the EU ban, but if it is this close, I worry that this initiative as well as the EU ban where made to seem environmentally friendly while making the bigger problem bigger. 

So I hope someone have a link to a study that shows me that I worry for nothing."
r/worldnews,"We need this.   We need to also make littering as socially unacceptable as smoking in public places is today.  I'm sick of picking up littered plastics, plastic bags and knowing what I manage to put into the bin is the tip of the iceberg.

r/worldnews,Blah blah blah. Words words words. Vote for him and nothing will happen. Just yet another politician.
r/worldnews,"Single use plastics are very prominent in the news recently but we do need to think about prioritisation. Single use plastics are produced from hydrocarbons and are basically a store of carbon, so that many waste to energy plants are just extremely inefficient fossil fuel plants. Also many (not all) single use plastics are necessary to reduce food spoilage/minimise the ‚Äúdead weight‚Äù when shipping products. If recyclable glass bottles are 10x the weight of plastic, the extra energy expended in transporting and recycling the glass bottles can have a higher impact than single use plastics that stay out of the ocean and end up in landfill"

r/worldnews,"The alternative is corn-based PLA ""plastic"".  It biodegrades in a short time in most environments, and NOT into microplastic particles.  In fact you can add it to a mulch pile and use it on your garden.

PLA plastic silverware costs about $0.15/piece, though, but it is on the market.

PLA was used in a Sun Chips bag.  It became infamous for being ""very loud"" and taken off the market

r/worldnews,"Can we please make this an issue for the corporates that offer consumers no choice whether to use plastic, coca cola is the biggest producers of plastic but apparently it's the consumer that's to blame despite not being asked if we want our products wrapped in plastic or not. Maybe the oil companies can face massive fines every year for their contribution to the problem"

r/worldnews,"Why isn't anyone seriously considering launching it all into space. Then we won't have to deal with it. Like, there are no possible downsides to a giant ball of burning garbage hurtling through space. And don't tell me it won't be burning, if there is anything Matt Groenig science has taught me, it is tire fires will burn forever no matter what."

r/worldnews,Man Black Mirror was a good show... Vote for Waldo!
r/worldnews,"He is being promoted by two of the three richest people of the country - oligarchs [Ihor Kolomoysky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ihor_Kolomoyskyi) and [Gennady Bogoliubov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennadiy_Bogolyubov). The former owns a TV channel (called ""1+1"") where the comedian runs all his shows. The channel unexpectedly [let the comedian give the New Year 2019 Presidential speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjc4kcx8mlw) instead of the president.

There were journalist investigations showing that Zelensky's (the comedian) company received money laundered by the oligarch Kolomoysky - about $41M ([google translate](https://translate.google.com.ua/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fkorrespondent.net%2Fukraine%2F4070812-arev-pokazal-skhemu-kak-yz-pryvatbanka-vyvely-41-mln)).

Ihor Kolomoysky used to own the by far biggest bank in the country - PrivatBank. It had to be nationalized a couple years ago. It turned out that a lot of money had been laundered out of the bank and it had to be refinanced by $5.5B, which is a crazy amount for such a poor country as Ukraine. The nationalization was scrutinized by IMF and got approved ([link](https://www.ft.com/content/81f6cd38-eadd-38d8-81e5-9e0f729345eb)). Major European governments expressed support for this decision as well.

Ihor Kolomoysky now wants a revenge as part of his assets were arrested and wants the case in the court of London against him to be dropped. A few days ago a Ukrainian court declared nationalizing of PrivatBank illegal. Looks like the bank will go back to the oligarch ([link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-privatbank/i-won-says-ukraine-tycoon-as-court-rules-privatbank-nationalization-illegal-idUSKCN1RU1KY)).

Whenever asked about anything, Zelensky either gives vague non-answers or says ""we'll do it somehow, I don't know how"" or ""I'll figure it out later"". It's been like this for 4 months since his announcement to run and he doesn't seem to have figured anything out so far. He only presented his team two days before final election round. The team of 'new people' contains people from ousted president Yanukovych party and still lacks some of the key positions.

After the 5 hard years people are tired and they want a miracle and vote for the guy that says he'll fix everything. As a Ukrainian, I'd love to be wrong, but it will be a shitshow.

**Edit: an important thing**. As a Ukrainian, I'd be happy to have been wrong here. If Zelensky actually turns out to be at least not worse than the current president, I'd relax and celebrate with friends; the champagne would be on me. I'd be waking up a happy person. But my mind doesn't leave me at ease here. The facts are telling a different story. Would be happy to be wrong."

&gt; KIEV - Ukrainians began voting on Sunday in an election expected to thrust a comedian with no prior political experience into the presidency of a country at war and hungry for change.

&gt; Surveys make Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who plays a fictitious president in a TV series, the overwhelming favorite to defeat incumbent Petro Poroshenko, whose popularity has been dragged down by patchy efforts to tackle corruption and sliding living standards.

&gt; NO CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT. Zelenskiy&amp;#039;s rise comes at a time of a political upheaval in many parts of the world, from Brexit to the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, the 5-Star Movement in Italy - also inspired by a comedian - and the rise of the far right there, in France and in Spain.

r/worldnews,"To add to the surrealism. He was in a popular Ukrainian TV comedy show in which he played...  the president. An unlikely president selected from the working class, no less. His political party is named after the show and the two share a logo.

That being said, in reality Zelensky is more than a comedian (though that is an accurate characterization), but is a producer and has had a litany of high ranking positions in broadcasting and production in Ukraine. He's wealthy and has known connections to the infinitely wealthier oligarch class. So, this is not quite as zany as it may at first appear or, perhaps, as Zelensky himself may prefer. He'd still be my choice were I casting a vote, don't get me wrong, but some perspective is needed.

I have parents messaging me constantly through these apps that the school requires us to have and if I don‚Äôt reply in an hour or so of receiving the message then I am sent aggressive and passive aggressive messages in return. In fact, Last night at 10 PM I received a message from a parent asking me a question about whether his child left her coat in my classroom on Friday. I didn‚Äôt answer because it was Saturday night and I was out with my family. Today, at 8 AM on a Sunday I received a follow up message which was, ‚Äú?....‚Äù.
I told them I wasn‚Äôt sure and that I could check after spring break is over since I‚Äôm not in the building...
This is just a small sample of what my life is like as a teacher nowadays."
r/worldnews,Tell them to fuck off. Not politically correct but this isn‚Äôt their job
r/worldnews,"These parents ruin their kids. It‚Äôs not just their kids school and teachers they act this way in. 

They micro manage their kids and bulldoze anything that gets in their kids way. 

They create a needy kid who has zero critical thinking or problem solving skills- but it‚Äôs kewl cause their kid has straight a‚Äôs!"
r/worldnews,"I would love it if every teacher in the UK, my country and every other country where this stuff goes on would just quit. All of them at the same time. Tell parents and governments to fuck off. This would create enormous problems for (entitled)parents and governments and would give teachers all the power."
r/worldnews,"Maybe the teachers should be given a separate email, or a work phone that they can turn off and don't touch until mon-friday school hours. 

It's ridiculous how much entitlement some parents have. Well, perhaps the teachers could be texting the parents at all hours making sure they've brushed their teeth, turned off the TV, done their homework, been given a proper dinner etc etc. I mean, if parents think they can tell a teacher how to bring up their kids at all hours, it's only fair right?"
r/worldnews,Parents like this should just home school their kids.
r/worldnews,"The majority of people I meet in this country are either rude or entitled or both. Why is being a kind, genuine, friendly person so unpopular nowadays."
r/worldnews,"The headmistress and deputy headmistress of my school ended up retiring the year I finished Primary School because a group of 6 student's parents were sending them death threats over their grades and Secondary School placements.

Mrs. West and Ms. Milton were such great figures in my early life and to this day it haunts me that 6 out of our class of 28 had parents who tormented them to the point of which future classes will never be able to benefit their enthusiasm and care.

That was 1996. The UK has been unchecked crazy for this shit for years. I can only imagine how bad it is with apps and e-mail in the picture.

r/worldnews,We actually had this in college (not proper college like 16-18) but it was because student where messaging tutors too much outside of work time .
r/worldnews,"This is the kind of stuff that makes me happy I work in an urban district where parents don't reach out often. Of course, ideally the best parent is an engaged and active one, but having to deal with something like this with all the other issues were forced with would be absolutely unbearable."
r/worldnews,"I have a good friend who taught for years in a public school full of poor and at risk children in the poorest city in our county. Now she teaches in a public school in the wealthiest city in the state. The entitlement is real and though it takes different forms, it seems it's common at both ends of the socioeconomic spectrum."
r/worldnews,"My mom, teaching university courses, would get emails and phone calls from parents. These students are adults, and their parents are calling. And since they are adults my mom couldn't discuss anything with their parents if she wanted to."

r/worldnews,"Modern parents are complete idiots who are raising their kids to be spoiled, non-thinking jerks who cannot function in the real world."
r/worldnews,"Perhaps it is time to change the law a little, so people who contact civil servants at unreasonable hours, could be charged after a milder form of harassment. That should solve the issue quickly."
r/worldnews,"""Entitlement"" or ""trophy generation"" like I see in this thread is the Facebook meme catnip that doesn't actually explain any issues or why people are responding to their environment in a certain way.

The economy has changed to leave the middle class in an increasingly precarious situation wrt job prospects and future savings. Without that security everyone has become neurotic about their status, including the future income and status of their kids.

This thread might call it entitlement, I call it people shitting their pants in fear if their kid can't become a lawyer or code. They see how everyone else outside of the knowledge fields is getting treated and think that they have to push their kid up that hill at any cost"

r/worldnews,"Parents shouldn‚Äôt expect to have their children‚Äôs educators social media contact, it‚Äôs entirely out of line"

If not, every time I got an email or text or phone call from some pushy parent, I‚Äôd just add them to the blocked list and never hear from them again. If the parents really need to get a message to a teacher, they can do it via the school office."
r/worldnews,And thus destroyed once great British Educational System. RIP.
r/worldnews,Lol. This is stupid.

r/worldnews,"If wire an instructor, I would have two phone numbers, one for family only, one I share with the school only, as that number leaks,  hanged it and only notify HR, and just keep doing it. My wife is in Para education and the parents believe the school system should be run for them, by them, and only to serve their little one, and the rest do not matter. Parents are getting way too much attention is schools. Demanding is a better word for it, and the staff are caving in to it..."
r/worldnews,My mom's a German teacher and she complains about the same things. Nowadays parents have messenger groups and despite their kids becoming more and more less independent and they act like their they are geniuses.

r/worldnews,"I don't think I would last as a teacher.  I would show these emails to my class.  

Ok kids let's see what little Jimmy's parents had to say about this class.  Now bonus points for pointing out spelling and grammar error."
r/worldnews,"The problem is crazy complex. What's at the heart of the problem are family Dynamics. Things have changed drastically in the last 50 years. While it's has never been a better time to be alive it's also a time where both parents in 9/10 households must work to provide a home, means of travel, food and recreational money for the family. I would say this is the standard of living one should be able to expect. Sadly, we all work long hours, we all are dead tired and as a result some are less and less in touch with their family. We see our co-workers more than our own family. We know more about our co-workers than our own family. The problem with this posts topic is just this .... Teachers don't need to talk to the parents the parents need to talk to their children. A loving and involved family will know everything there is to know about school. If there are issues where the parents do need to speak with the teacher and that teacher isnt getting back to you then it's lesson time. A lesson to teach your children patients, compassion and communication...why? Teachers are overworked just like everyone else, teach them to understand others feelings and teach them how to approach conversations differently to get what they need. In the end I hope we're able to one day work less, spend more time with family  whilst still being able to afford the standard of living we come to enjoy today. I'm extremely sad some days that I spend less and less time with my family but cherish every minute I do. Sadly I'm not socio-economics major but I do hope our world can evolve to value family and social connections more than $'s. Peace and love"
r/worldnews,"This absolute bullshit. Schools need to have strict policies on this sort of harassment, and there should be legal consequences."
r/worldnews,"Isn't this easily solved by ""reporting,"" ""blocking"" and ""ignoring"" ""aggressive"" parents?"
r/worldnews,why the fuck is The Independent allowed on here?
r/worldnews,"Here‚Äôs what should happen: you hit a teacher, you get thrown in fucking jail for 2 days. That‚Äôs how it works where I live."
r/worldnews,"This is wrong and not new and totally sensationalised. I don‚Äôt get the problem. You must keep your work and private stuff separate like we do in private sector. I don‚Äôt deal with work emails out of hours or use my own email address or messaging for ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù. Out of hours, notifications are off. Clients email me and message me sometimes at 11pm on sat night. Not my fucking problem until Monday morning! If you make yourself available then people will assume you are always available.

Ultimately poor management of your own communications is a piss poor excuse to threaten quitting. There are plenty of better ones if you are a teacher!

Edit: also if you‚Äôre in a public position, lock down your social media otherwise people will find you and you‚Äôll have to beat them off with a shitty stick.

r/worldnews,"&gt; President Reuven Rivlin showed his displeasure with the \[nation state\] law by signing it into law with his Arabic signature.

Haha, that's a nice one. The least he could do in his otherwise powerless role of president. It is well known that he's a man of principles, even while being technically a right wing politician. Bibi hates him so much for that."
r/worldnews,The intense xenophobia seems pathetic coming from a group that had experienced one of the worse genocides in modern history (and by modern  I mean in the last 100y) you think they would've learned that lesson... that this kind of behavior is reprehensible.
r/worldnews,"The headline is fake and misleading. Obviously 10s of thousands of Arab children attend public funded kindergartens in Jerusalem.

The article was about a security alert sent by the school district last week that warned against **Adults not connected to the schools** being allowed on school property, it had a disgusting racist term in it that the school district apologized for and removed after complaints from an anti-racism group.

The headline attached to this article makes it falsely appear that Arab children are not allowed to attend public funded kindergarten in Jerusalem which is a complete lie.

**In fact Arab Israelis are provided public education.**

[http://taubcenter.org.il/the-state-of-public-preschool-education-in-israel/](http://taubcenter.org.il/the-state-of-public-preschool-education-in-israel/)

&gt;The implementation of the  Compulsory Education Law led to a 54 percent enrollment increase in Preschool  in the Arab Israeli sector between 2000 and 2005,  
&gt;  
&gt;Comparing the preschool enrollment rate of Arab children with that of Jewish children.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2000, 49 percent of Arab Israeli children and 85 percent of Jewish Israeli children attended public preschools.  
&gt;  
&gt;**In 2010, by comparison, about 71 percent of 3-5 year-old Arab Israeli children and 84 percent of 3-5 year-old Jewish Israeli children attended public preschools.**"
r/worldnews,"I would just like to advise people to read past the title as it's very misleading. This is certainly racist, however, the title creates a completely different story than what is written in the article. 
While the title suggests that education is denied to Arabs, the article clarifies that it's the entrance of unauthorized foreigners to the premises of kindergartens, and furthermore that Israeli anti-racist organizations already talked against it stating that this instruction is actually illegal.
Again, the instruction isn't necessarily justified in any way but it isn't nearly as terrible as the title makes it out to be. Just something to keep in mind in general when forming opinions on such matters using titles."
r/worldnews,"Organized religion is the bane of our existence. Contrary to popular belief, we'd be a lot kinder without it."

Which when translated to English is:

Entry is not allowed for forfeigners, in general, minorities are not authorized to enter.

And then it says they have to get permission from an ""anti-terrorism"" officer.


It's funny how Hasbara is trying to excuse this racism by saying ""everything is cool the minorities can enter they just need to be authorized first, no such requirements for Jews though!"" As if treating every minority as a security threat by default isn't racist.

I had always thought that the Ainu people and language were recognized, so this is new to me, and I am quite happy to know that it is now official."

r/worldnews,"In the past, Japan wanted to create a myth that the great Yamato race was descendent of the Sun Goddess, and absolutely did not migrate from the Korean Peninsula and China (those are the inferior race). 

The existence of native people in the Japanese islands that are distinctly a different race seems to contradict that myth so erasing their existence is what Japan did.

Japan still shit on its minority populations (there are a non trivial number of Koreans and Chinese in Japan where they move there from imperialism era)."
r/worldnews,Golden Kamuy FTW.
r/worldnews,I was totally not expecting Oki Kano to show up on CNN today. So happy! He is one of my favorite musicians.

r/worldnews,"I read that upwards of 40% of Japanese men have the same Y-chromosome as the Ainu, and about 50% have the O kind commonly found in China.

In other words, it seems that the average Japanese person is a mix of Chinese-like newcomers and Ainu-like natives."
r/worldnews,This have something to do with the new emperor?
r/worldnews,"It's amazing the comments here still defending the Japanese distortion and white washing of history. The Ainu were definitely suppressed and discriminated (still are to an extent). There is definite evidence they inhabited northern Honshu, though primarily they were in Hokkaido. The ""pure"" Japanese, so-called Yamato people (a term with historically shady origins, starting about the time eugenics and concepts of pure blood were rising in Japan), are not native but a mix of Jomon (native) and Yayoi (from mainland, related likely to Korean/Chinese) peoples, by most supported theories. 

Just because you dont outright say a race is inferior doesnt make you not racist. Changing ethnic history and geography to subtly or not so subtly suit your opinions is a less overt but no less damaging way of doing it."
r/worldnews,Maybe in another 600 years they will officially recognize their long list of war crimes.
r/worldnews,I went to an Ainu village in Hokkaido two years ago. Everyone was incredibly friendly. There was a long winded musical performance that I didn't understand at all. The museum was average and there was also a bear being kept in a cage in awful conditions. 4/10 would not Ainu again.

At the same time I can sympathize with these protesters. I don‚Äôt agree with their methods, but I think I can understand what they‚Äôre saying. There‚Äôs abundant money for old monuments of brick and stone, but where‚Äôs the money for the present day flesh and bone struggling to survive? I‚Äôm not a religious person but I respect what Jesus had to say and I think what he would want people to do is care for the poor before we care for an inanimate structure.

Also, from a historical perspective, is there anything more French than taking to the streets and destroying stuff?"
r/worldnews,"What I find interesting is that the Notre Dame cathedral is public property. A public asset was burnt down. It makes revenue for the country, and it's supported with the people's taxes. That means one way or the other, it is going to be rebuilt. 

Isn't it maybe a bit better that the rich do something benevolent (as so rarely happens) and take that burden off the public, expediting it's reconstruction with an increase in related jobs, rather than it taking much longer using government money?"

I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôll see reform anytime soon, since the church views women as second class, subservients.  The priests also take advantage of their positions of authority to molest children.  Priesthood is THE perfect cover for these monsters."

r/worldnews,"Why this organization still exists is beyond me..

Do you think it's safe to say the overwhelming majorty of clergy are baby boomers?"
r/worldnews,I think a big part of the problem is the church‚Äôs refusal to allow priests to marry and have normal sexual relationships. Ultimately one of the main philosophies of the church is that we are all sinners who do things that will require the forgiveness of Christ. To force these men who often enter the clergy really early on in life to repress their inherent sexuality into secret relations and whatnot only leads to these kinds of problems. The various Protestant churches which do allow marriages don‚Äôt seem to deal with this much (though they‚Äôre usually smaller congregations and not a large multinational organization so it‚Äôs hard to gauge).

Moreover, the **UK has gone up 7 ranks from 40th to 33rd**. This better rank isn't because of others deteriorating either:  the UK's score has got better.

The Independent, as usual, is a rag seeking to make the UK look bad by comparing it to Jamaica (appealing to the expectation that Jamaica would do badly). Jamaica frequently does well, ranking 6th last year and 8th this year. Rather offensive to the countries named, I think.

r/worldnews,"""Despite improvements in some  areas and the presence of a robust independent media, the UK remained  one of the worst-ranked Western European countries in the World Press  Freedom Index, largely due to a heavy-handed approach towards the press,  often in the name of national security.

In September, the  UK‚Äôs mass surveillance regime was found to violate the European  Convention on Human Rights, including with respect to the protection of  journalistic sources. New counter-terrorism and crime legislation was  introduced that would restrict reporting and put journalists‚Äô data ‚Äì and  their ability to guarantee source protection ‚Äì at risk. The government  continued to explore means of restricting encryption tools. In March,  then-Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Matt  Hancock announced that the threatening Section 40 of the Crime and  Courts Act 2013 would not be implemented, and the government would seek  repeal at the ‚Äúfirst appropriate opportunity‚Äù ‚Äì which has not yet  happened. The adoption of Magnitsky legislation via an amendment to the  Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act in May was a welcome step  towards holding press freedom predators to account, but is not yet being  implemented.

r/worldnews,"That's Greece, nationally and individually - always looking for someone else to pay the bills."
r/worldnews,I don't see a problem with this. We will be drowning in cash once we have gotten the reparations from Italy for Augustus's campaigns.
r/worldnews,think it's a bit late to be making wartime claims when the EU has already bailed you out of collapse. A huge chunk of EU funding comes from Germany. They will get absolutely nothing and the other EU members will hate them more just for asking.
r/worldnews,"For those referring to the 2+4 treaty, this was with USA, USSR, France and UK. Greece was never a part of it, so nothing was settled with Greece with that treaty. 

I agree that reparations should not be paid by Germany after all these years. But the loan agreement, the loan that Greece was forced to give to Nazi Germany at the time, now worth around 12b, should be paid, because it was a loan. And it was never paid. 70 years is not too long for national debt. For those saying that Greece is biting the hand that feeds them, maybe consider that if Greece's infrastructure had not been 90% destroyed by the Nazis, if10% of Greeks had not died as a result of Nazi occupation, if Greece had received reparations and if Germany had repaid the loan, maybe Greece would not need to be fed. 

How is it ok to demand Greeks pay back the debt and the loans with huge sacrifices, while the Germans simply say 'no, you should have asked earlier'. Well Greece asked earlier, Germany just was more powerful and did not want to pay. 

At the end of the day, don't pay. But you have no right to call Greeks all the things you are calling them in this sub, when Greeks are actually making good on their loans, while Germans just say no."
r/worldnews,Didn't Germany recently bail out Greece when their economy was tanking?

r/worldnews,Do they want ww3 is this how we got into the second one?
r/worldnews,"In this thread: people who don't know shit talking smack about ""Germany bailing out Greece"".

&amp;#x200B;

Greece was **forced** to take loans from the IMF, the ECB, and the EC (the Troika) so that they could **pay back bonds that European and other international banks had bet on heavily.**  In order to be able to pay back the loans, Greece was forced into severe austerity measures that included cutting government pensions i.e. money people had paid over many years with the expectation of having it in retirement, cutting wages for government employees, and cutting back on infrastructure spending.  The result was a decade-long recession with unemployment hitting 25%, a spike in suicides, and people still suffering today.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Ordinary Greek citizens took a huge hit so some banks wouldn't take a haircut on bonds that represented a tiny fraction of their overall investments.  All the money ""loaned"" to Greece left the country immediately and went to those banks."
r/worldnews,So grease just wants more money because they deserve because they don‚Äôt have any
r/worldnews,"I realise reddit tends to see this as beggar Greece playing the victim card now that they owe Germany money. But the simple reality is Germany has never made amends for its crimes in Greece, and the Greeks have never stopped demanding satisfaction. 

Germany slaughtered their way through Greece, raping, burning and massacring countless towns and villages. 7% of Greece's population were killed. And they set loose Bulgarians in the north to ethnically cleanse hundreds of thousands of Greeks from the region to hand over the territory to Bulgaria. 

Greece recieved a single reparation payment, vastly below what was owed, then the US and UK decided the matter was closed. Greece is not the only country, Poland is also still demanding compensation, a demand both countries have never abandoned their claim to. 

The US estimated Germany owes Greece something like $17 trillion in property damage alone. Greece is asking for $300 billion, a tiny fraction that Germany can easily afford, the kind of sum countries like Germany have blown on quantitive easing many times in the past. France, Britain, the low countries, etc seized what they were owed in 1945, Greece got nothing. 

Germany also owes Greece $12.5 billion for a forced loan Greece was compelled to give Germany during WW2. Regardless of what you think of the state of the reparations, Germany refusing to repay this is legally indefensible.

I'm not even Greek and I find reddit's circlejerking about this grotesque. Worse still I see Germans with the nerve to mock Greeks for this after their history. A cursory look on wikipedia would reveal the extent of Germany's crimes in Greece, which went far beyond the crimes committed against France, etc, second only to Poland. 

Germany owes Greece, bailouts or no, and it's incredibly happy and easy for Germany to be able to write off what they owe against what they've lent to Greece. It's the best deal they'll ever get."
r/worldnews,"Idk on one hand they deserve reperations, but on the other hand, why bring this up after the Germans borrowed you billions? Kind of a dick move, I wouldnt have supported all this money being sent to Greece, if I knew what kind of anger and hatred we would get in return. Quite disappointing."

I see a lot of surprised Americans here, so, let's put it into perspective and list just 3 facts that make me, as European,  concord with Russia analysis.
(Of course Russia has all the reasons to make propaganda about this fact,  they're riding this horse to push their agenda, but what they're saying is true)

-- Under the Trump administration, America is isolating from the rest of the international community in a lot of different arenas (exiting from the Paris Deal or the Iran Deal are exampls) 

--Before Trump, we in Europe discovered that the NSA was illegaly spying on every prime minister/president in every European country. How can you trust an Ally that illegally spy on you? 


--The wars led by the Americans in the Middle East greatly destabilized the area, causing the actual Migrant Crysis, one of the main problems in Europe today and one of the causes of the rise of populism all around europe.

Deforestation occurs when you are harvesting timber on an industrial scale, one off restorations like this are entirely within the capacity of a forest to provide lumber. It‚Äôs like comparing whale harvests by Alaskan natives using traditional methods to industrial harvesting using factory ships: they aren‚Äôt on the same scale.

Europe has about 95% less forest coverage in the 21st century compared to the 12th century.

*****
&gt; Facebook&amp;#039;s controversial factchecking program is partnering with the Daily Caller, a rightwing website that has pushed misinformation and is known for pro-Trump content.

&gt; Asked about its collaboration with the Daily Caller, a Facebook spokesperson noted that any news organization can apply to join the program after it gains certification from the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network, run by the journalism institute Poynter.

&gt; This week, a Wired investigation on Facebook reported that a vice-president at the company had once argued that the Facebook newsfeed should treat the content from Daily Caller and Breitbart, another rightwing outlet, in the same manner as stories from mainstream news outlets.

r/worldnews,"Wait, I‚Äôm as distrustful of Daily Caller and Tucker Carlson as anyone, but Facebook says it partners with any fact-checker certified by the established fact-checking association run by Poynter, and that includes Check Your Fact, which is an affiliate of Daily Caller.  But CYF has been around for years and nothing in this article suggests that it is unreliable. It could very well be unreliable, but if so then THAT would be the basis for criticism.

What would be Facebook‚Äôs basis for not allowing this certified fact-checking site when they allow others? It can‚Äôt be affiliation with Daily Caller because lots of them have affiliations with news and opinion sources.

This article is pointless without evidence that Check Your Fact is biased. I checked the Media Bias analysis and they have CYF as ‚Äúslightly to moderately conservative in bias‚Äù solely because of the facts that they tend to check, but says this:

&gt; does not diminish the quality and veracity of the fact check. Check Your Fact uses appropriate neutral language in both headlines and articles...Like all credible fact checkers they utilize proper sources and experts within the field to validate the claim they are fact checking.

r/worldnews,Honestly not worth the time. Do your own research and draw your own conclusion. Not one MSM is honest
r/worldnews,"Is ""pushed misinformation"" the cut off now? Because then literally every media org should not be allowed"
r/worldnews,"Is this ""misinformation"" actually misinformation or is it just things some people don't agree with?

Also note that every media org out there is guilty of this - misinformation is unintentional as opposed to disinformation which is intentional.

I'd like to see an equal amount of left and right media orgs participate, rather than a pure left majority like many want."
r/worldnews,"Delete your Facebook account. Facebook is actively working to undermine democracy and the rule of law, and profiting off your private information."
r/worldnews,"Is this a joke? One conservative website partners with Facebook to help them verify facts and the left goes crazy? The headline's premise is that they have pushed misinformation... I guarantee there would be no complaining if CNN became a partner, and they push more information than any news network/site."
r/worldnews,"With every article that comes out that mentions Facebook, I'm given more proof walking away from that social cesspool was the right decision."

r/worldnews,so pushing misinformation is only bad when it's the wrong people doing it
r/worldnews,"You could say the same thing for any media organisation that exists today. 

They all have an agenda. They are run by activists and radicals of the left/right. That's why political discourse is so toxic."
r/worldnews,"I have an idea, how about teaching people to think critically and do proper research? These whole fact checking programs are nothing more than a tool for corporations to influence public opinion. There is no website that hasn't published intentional misinformation. The Daily Caller does it, Fox News does, The Guardian does it, Snopes does it. This is all fucking pointless, and is already abused to high hell. Also I find it ironic that somebody would trust somebody as biased as guardian on this story. Of course there going to have something against the Daily Caller which leans right-wing. They're a left wing website and most importantly a competitor.

EDIT: Another thing to note, if you want a truly free society, you must tolerate stupid people."
r/worldnews,"Rightwing news sources is a problem but left-wing websites spreading misinformation is fine.

Libs don't want anything to disrupt their echo chamber."
r/worldnews,"On the other hand, they are also partnered with several left wing websites which have pushed misinformation, and Daily Caller really isn't any worse than, say, snopes."
r/worldnews,Has it? Or is ‚Äònews that isn‚Äôt fodder for leftist confirmation bias‚Äô suddenly ‚Äòmisinformation‚Äô?
r/worldnews,"Good luck finding a news org that hasn't published false info other than wikileaks which has only heavily alluded to false info.

Also, good luck finding a news org that doesn't have strong opinions on Trump.

If this is what we're working with to begin with, then I don't see the problem with facebook partnering with some conservative sites since they're also partnering with liberal ones."

r/worldnews,They are pretty factual. I don't have a problem with it. Don't be paranoid. You are complaining and you haven't even seen if it's not factual. Don't holler before you're hurt.
r/worldnews,The guardian calling out the daily caller for pedalling misinformation? That kettle must be pretty black.
r/worldnews,Didn't the entire MSM push misinformation for the past 2 years?
r/worldnews,So kinda like the left wing websites that it currently uses that push misinformation?
r/worldnews,Did they push anything as fake as the Trump-Russia collusion hysteria?
r/worldnews,Facebook is full of shit with just about everything. They don't like what you say so they'll tell you it's hate speech. Everything with them is a double standard.
r/worldnews,"Yeah....this coming from the fucking Guardian. Lmao hey Guardian,  how did your Russia articles age? How about Trump absolutely being impeached? How about the Covington catholic kids? How about the Jussie Smulett shit? How about how Brett Kavanaugh was absolutely a rapist?

So, it's cool when hyper left wing gets ahold of it but not mildly right wing?"
r/worldnews,What misinformation? Trump working for the Russians? Trump being blackmailed about having escorts pee on him? Nevermind that‚Äôs CNN/MSNBC
r/worldnews,find me a news organization that hasn‚Äôt pushed misinformation
r/worldnews,"If you get your 'facts' from Facebook, you're gonna have a bad time."
r/worldnews,You really think the Guardian isn't biased?
r/worldnews,Weren't they partnered with the SPLC at one point? They really have no clue what they are doing.
r/worldnews,Which media outlet hasn‚Äôt published misinformation in the last 36 months? Primary sources &gt; media outlets.
r/worldnews,"The people screaming fake news the loudest are the ones spreading it the most, and now they're the ones who get to help decide what is fake news. Makes perfect sense."
r/worldnews,"Because the alliance of snopes, politifact, and the splc has worked out so well. The daily caller is barely even decaf level conservative, such a negative reaction to hiring different groups to stave off groupthink and confirmation bias only shows how bigoted the modern left is. All the diversity except for thought."

r/worldnews,Suicide/Suicide Bombing Is NOT a part of Islam NOR is it acceptable. Those people who carry out such attacks CLAIM to be Muslims and CLAIM to be following the religion when they are in fact NOT following Islam
r/worldnews,"Calm?  
It would be perfectly justified to instead call for action.  
Rise up against perpetrators, supporters and financiers of religious terrorism."
r/worldnews,Please do not post videos or photos of the persons harmed or of the explosions. This only incites hatred against Muslims and or Islam. Remember that it is done and we must move forward in understanding the reasons why this happened and not accuse any one group of hate.
r/worldnews,"Shame.

If there's any one to blame, its the polarizing attitude the government has been forcing on us.

It's the government who got %51 of the votes, and calling the rest %49 a terrorist, basically because they didn't vote for him.

The government who controls almost all the media, still losing 2 biggest cities in local elections, is to blame. Media outlets have repeatedly called Opposition parties terrorists, in hopes of gathering some votes from unedicated, narrow minded people.

It's the government who repeatedly accuse Opposition Party leader of treason, whilst they're the one who are not following Ataturk's teachings.

r/worldnews,Their peaceful civil disobedience is fantastic. This is what needs to happen until there's real change.
r/worldnews,"Okay, see a lot of posts saying that what the protestors are doing is increasing pollution, that they are blocking emergency services and not actually effecting the big corporations. 

[Here is a link](https://www.londonair.org.uk/LondonAir/general/news.aspx?newsId=51foyPVtvieVKszzVKLKlX) to a study by Kings College, shows that there has been a decrease in pollution in the centre of town. Since it's been a week of this, a lot of people will probably be opting to use the tube and avoiding their cars as they know roads are blocked. 

There was a Guardian article that stated millions of pounds has been lost out by the businesses in the centre of town, I can't find it now. This is important to note as fast fashion is one of the most environmentally damaging industries.

[Here is a link to a video of an XR representative talking on Good Morning Britain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KnMSdY1yT0), he talks clearly about their aims and also states that they have been working with the emergency services for months to make sure that they can get through during this time. 

As for the inconveniencing ordinary people, XR are very clear that they do not wish to do this, but feel it is necessary. I'd rather be late to work because someone wanted to do something about climate change. Yes, you might think we already do enough, but we can always do more. 

If you really disagree with their methods or have ideas on how to improve, really the most effective thing you can do is get involved.

r/worldnews,The protesters demand the death penalty for her attackers and for the headmaster who apparently ordered the attack from prison after he was arrested over her sexual assault allegations. 18 people have been arrested in conjunction with the murder.
r/worldnews,The headmaster and her five killers need to start rotting in a prison cell asap.
r/worldnews,"Clever guy. Went from a local story about sexual abuse, to an international story about a gruesome murder."
r/worldnews,"May the rule of law bring justice.  People in power apparently acted with impunity:

&gt;The 18 arrested include the seminary headmaster. One of those accused of the attack told a closed court earlier this week that the principal ordered the killing.

&gt;The local head of the ruling Awami League party has been detained for allegedly helping the killers."
r/worldnews,"I don't get the principal's logic here. He has someone accusing him of rape, so while he's incarcerated someone attacks said accuser and burns her alive; apparently under his orders. That's just almost proves he's guilty."
r/worldnews,"Being of Bengali descent, while this crime is portraying one of the worst kind of heinous crimes you can imagine, I am happy to see people of all backgrounds riling up to see that justice will be served. 

While I don‚Äôt agree with the death punishment, Bangladesh was (and still is to a high degree, but I think pretty much every government is) quite corrupted, and I‚Äôm happy to see that both government and people won‚Äôt let this slide. 

You might not know this but professors in Bangladesh are held in a very high regard, for their students they can almost be celebrities, students wanting to be their student‚Äôs pets; and they usually have friends in high political ranks. Both my dad and my uncle were university professors, so I‚Äôve seen first hand students who come to their houses on weekends to sometimes give them gifts. So to see a professor not being able to wriggle himself out of this situation is quite optimistic. Well, I guess we will see how it turns out, but here‚Äôs to hoping."
r/worldnews,The people protesting are really brave.
r/worldnews,"It‚Äôs scary that events like these happen too often :/

Literally just yesterday, a similar incident happened and the university tried to hush her up. Only because it went viral, did the msm (mainstream media) finally take notice of this and the University said they‚Äôll relook into it.

A male adult student filmed a female student in the showers and has gotten away with a slap on the wrist and a lousy 7 line ‚Äúapology letter‚Äù (email). And they tried to keep the girl quiet by getting her not to escalate the matter and sweeping it under the rug. : /

&gt; Bangladeshis protest after sexually assaulted girl burned to deathDhaka: Demonstrations were held across the Bangladesh capital Saturday for the tenth consecutive day after a teenager who accused a head teacher of sexually harassing her was burned to death.

&gt; Protesters in Dhaka chanted slogans demanding the death sentence for the killers of the girl, who police say was lured to the rooftop of the seminary she attended in Feni, south of the capital.

&gt; Police said the attackers then ordered her to withdraw a police complaint against the head of the school.

r/worldnews,Ohh this is infuriating. I hope justice is served
r/worldnews,That‚Äôs messed up. Who burns a person
r/worldnews,"The only good thing to come out of all of this is exposure - good people won't stand for this, and this can be the start of real change.

That teenager was a hero to stand up for herself when the penalty was death."
r/worldnews,"Confusing sentence... who was burned, the teacher or the student?"
r/worldnews,"Students in Bangladesh are some of the strongest kids I've ever seen, but fuck the government for not doing jackshit."
r/worldnews,Where do they even get the idea to *burn* someone to death.. Such horrifying cruelty.
r/worldnews,"Good for these demonstrators. This is beautiful to see. These archaic, sexist acts of violence to silence the victims of sexual abuse have no place in the modern world. These students are more mature and brave than the alleged leaders running their government and turning a blind eye to these blatant abuses of human rights."
r/worldnews,"Hopefully, this response will make people think before going along with another attack like this. Hopefully, the next corrupt asshole who tried to have others cover his tracks will get a ""Fuck off"" from the people he asks to carry it out.

But damn I wish protesters weren't asking for the death penalty."
r/worldnews,"It is very impressive but it is too late, and it will be too late for someone else if things don't change legislation and culture.

I mean don't go full brunei , please humans. 

Yes brunei for imbecilic theocracy."
r/worldnews,"oh wow that is f\*cked up. still a backwards society they live in where they protect the perp and blame the victim. just because the headmaster has a long history of being a pillar in society and to education, does not mean that he can get away with sexually assaulting young female students just because he is a respected person in the community or because he is up there in the echelon."
r/worldnews,How does a school headmaster (principle) have the power to ask people to set someone on fire and expect that they will comply?
r/worldnews,"And here in the west people complaining about the #MeToo movement, horrid."
r/worldnews,"The problem starts at home. This men or young boys aren‚Äôt thought to respect women. Even if you place laws men will still rape, beat and kill females."

r/todayilearned,"Steve-O suffered third degree burns after the fire gauntlet, Johnny said ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your pain level at?‚Äù

 Steve-O - ‚ÄúA normal person would ask for a pain killer.‚Äù

Johnny laughs unenthusiastically and replies ‚ÄúWell, you got your card revoked.‚Äù"
r/todayilearned,"There's a YouTube Original show called ""Ultimate Expedition,"" starring celebrities of all sorts that go international and attempt to do amazing feats (in the first season, it was climb a mountain in Peru), including Steve-O! In that show, it reveals just how much of a caring, compassionate person he is. 

Early in the season, Steve-O found a street dog, and he bought a 20 pound bag of dog food for her. He proceeded to take the dog to a vet, and then a pet 'spa' to groom her. That night, Steve-O tried to sneak her into the hotel they were staying at, was caught, and then set up a tent outside the hotel and slept with her in the tent. She never left his side, but only did once because he was off on the last leg of the climb on the mountain in extremely high altitude.

That's the best example from that show, but his interactions with the others on the show was just as pure-hearted."
r/todayilearned,Should have banned whippets too.
r/todayilearned,"The movie is also one of the best examples of 3d, because they actually used a 3d (half a million dollar) camera. rather then cheaper post effects.

r/todayilearned,"I met Steve O when I worked on a chatshow here in Ireland a few years ago. We would have American guests on from time to time (usually when comic cons were on) and some of them weren't very friendly (one of the actors from Charmed actually arrived stoned). He was a gentleman however and was really nice to everyone. One of my coworkers was a huge fan and brought her mum in to meet him and he was so cool about it. Great to see he's got his life back on track.

EDIT: It is rude, disrespectful and unprofessional to arrive to an interview stoned."
r/todayilearned,"I still remember when Bam called into Loveline and he was so distraught. He couldn‚Äôt understand what was going on with Steve-O. He wanted his friend back and he missed him. Dr. Drew explained that Steve-O doesn‚Äôt want to put himself around the alcohol and partying because it‚Äôs a bad influence on him. Bam just didn‚Äôt understand. You could hear the sadness in his voice.

I agree with Dr Drew that Steve-O needed to get away from that lifestyle, but hearing the sadness come from someone who has always been about just having a good time, at least on tv and movies and such, was very surreal. I really felt for the guy. Happy Steve-O got on the right track though. Good for him!"
r/todayilearned,"Copy of my comment from a previous post about Steve-O:

Steve-O was honestly one of my least favorite members of the crew back when it started. Just knowing how strung out he was on drugs just didn't really make me want to support that guy and the stupid stuff he would do. 

After he got sober his antics became funnier to me because you could now see the fear in his eyes and his mindset of ""I used to do all this??"" It made him more relatable and I think made for better stunts. 

I had the chance to meet him a few years back after one of his comedy shows and he was the nicest, coolest and actually sweetest celebs I ever met. I really became a bigger fan of his not just after meeting him but watching his transition to a sober, more aware person."
r/todayilearned,Shoutout to Chris Pontius from WildBoyz. I feel like he doesn‚Äôt get enough love on these Jackass threads.
r/todayilearned,Am I naive thinking that it would be stranger to allow beer on an exceptionally dangerous movie set?
r/todayilearned,"Knoxville and co. have consistently been some of the most caring, giving, genuinely compassionate people I‚Äôve ever seen onscreen, or even off.  I never would‚Äôve expected to guys behind Jackass to be some of the best role models a person could have."
r/todayilearned,"I think Steve-O has like 11 years clean and sober. He has transformed his life and he has helped lots of other guys kick booze and drugs. I think the service aspect (helping other guys stay sober) helps him most. 

Im 4 years sober and I‚Äôm just now gaining clarity on how much work life is. Just tonight there was a fire in my neighbors garage. The night before my car got broken into. 

Being sober I feel everything much more impactful. I feel like I have so much work to do by being a home owner. I mean I forgot to take my laptop inside and it gets broken into. So it‚Äôs like no mistakes. 

This is completely unrelated, but my friends father is from France and once he left his garage door open. Then nothing happened. He said that if that happened in France things would be stolen. Maybe he lives in a better neighborhood than me. 

The point is that if you are an addict/alcoholic then you see things differently. You take them all on as if you are responsible somehow. We don‚Äôt know where our line stops and the other persons line begins. We are victims of our own minds and delusional thinking. 

I actually think alcoholism is a disease the same as cancer. The difference is when an alcoholic is terminal he/she can take others out with them (drunk driving)

I guess this message is to help me stay sober. I miss Steve-O. I‚Äôve heard him talk about living a sober life and he is very inspiring. I do think Steve-O can be a role model. He is the only guy I know of from that group that has been able to keep his sobriety. 

I used to love watching jackass as a kid. And of course they were all fucked up. Steve-O said that he always wanted to be a stunt man so he dropped out of school and he because a world famous stunt man. 

While no body is perfect there are a lot of drunks who should be looking up to a sober Steve-O. If he can do it you can too."
r/todayilearned,"Steve-O is the most sane of the group today. Sometimes those who go through the lowest lows reach up to the highest heights. As a sober ex-drinker and junkie myself, I have the utmost respect for Steve-O. God bless him!"
r/todayilearned,"If they were to film another one, they would have to ban it for Bam."
r/todayilearned,"I‚Äôve been volunteering at a camp for people with disabilities since I was 11 and Steve-O donated 200 - 300 dollars to the camp. He also wore a camp t-shirt to his show later that night. I didn‚Äôt personally meet him, but my mother did and she said he was very funny and nice."
r/todayilearned,NICE
r/todayilearned,"and it won't always be like this, we live in a very fortunate miniscule timescale."
r/todayilearned,It's not just the odds of the sun and moon appearing as the same size - it's the 1:400 difference on a planet with sentient life able to observe it as well.
r/todayilearned,This makes our planet quite the tourist attraction for aliens some day.
r/todayilearned,"The sizes are the same ratio as their distances, except when they aren't because elliptical orbits."
r/todayilearned,400 times the size. 400 times the distance. Plus earth supports life. We won the interstellar lottery !
r/todayilearned,If this doesn't prove that pizza is top 5 best foods I don't know what will
r/todayilearned,"It's not quite that miraculous, as this was always an inevitability. The Moon used to be much closer to Earth, and it has slowly been moving away ever since. We happen to exist in a time where the distances match to give us what we see, but as time goes on, that will go away.

It's not like some grand architect plopped the Moon where it is and it's been there ever since."
r/todayilearned,Just another sign that we're living in a simulation.
r/todayilearned,Human beings know so little about the universe it would be no surprise if there were millions of combinations like these.
r/todayilearned,"I confess I don't understand a thing. As long as the moon is above a certain size, wouldn't the moon *always* block *some* of the sunlight for a certain geographic radius on the earth? 

So no matter how big that radius is, for the people under the shadow wouldn't it look like the moon fits the sun's size ""exactly""?"
r/todayilearned,"That's pretty neat. If it turns out to be pretty rare in the universe, the idea that it could be a ""tourist attraction"" for Aliens to travel to earth is really cool to me. I'm definitely going to be looking around at the faces I see in 2024.

Edit: I misremembered the date of the next North American total eclipse."
r/todayilearned,"I've always wondered is this insanely rare congruence is somehow responsible for the development of intelligent life, or at least culture. Like, without an eclipse now and again, maybe we would have peaked at home habilis."
r/todayilearned,"1:389 its rounded up for some bullshit numberology shit from religious morons.

r/todayilearned,Why we get beautiful eclipses.
r/todayilearned,This fact is why people who believe aliens secretly come to earth will look for then during eclipses. It is an astronomically uncommon event that would likely be an intragalactic tourist attraction

r/todayilearned,Thorn and wynn are also a direct adaptation of old English runes.
r/todayilearned,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabetical_order

Alphabetical order is not a natural thing.  Numbers logically increase (though not in Roman numerals).  But why arbitrarily dictate an order for the alphabet and put ""A"" first?  By frequency, ""e"" should be first.

It dates to 1st century BC, long predating the English alphabet in any form.  Library of Alexandria arbitrarily created a numerical order of letters to have a common standard of organizing books by author/title.  Before the Dewey Decimal system"
r/todayilearned,What about the long s that looks like a lower case f? ≈øuch as this

r/todayilearned,"My ‚Äòancient‚Äô last name had a yogh that got turned into a ‚ÄòZ‚Äô because it was the closest looking letter.  Completely changed the pronunciation of my surname.

I‚Äôve been thinking of starting the pronunciation  revolution for my family...the way it is, it‚Äôs constantly butchered.  I don‚Äôt think people in my family even pronounce it the same way."
r/todayilearned,They're still included in the international phonetic alphabet. We had to learn them in linguistics (actually pretty useful).
r/todayilearned,"Great. Now let‚Äôs get rid of C, Q, and X. They are all superfluous. At least the X is sexy but still."
r/todayilearned,Also the ampersand was considered a letter. As for thorn it made a 'th' sound. The advent of moveable type led to the letter y being substituted for thorn which is how we got 'ye olde'.
r/todayilearned,Good riddance.
r/todayilearned,I‚Äôve seem something close to that ae in modern books.  Can‚Äôt recall exactly- possibly Ian Fleming.
r/todayilearned,I still see ash (√¶) appeare in dictionaries here and there.
r/todayilearned,All I do is ∆ø ∆ø ∆ø. I'm a terrible person for this.
r/todayilearned,"Most, if not all, of these letters disappeared because of the printing press. Since the printing presses came from France, which didn't have thorn (√æ), eth (√∞), wynn (∆ø), yogh (»ù), ash (√¶), and ethel (≈ì) on their typesets, they replaced them with letters that English didn't use, like y. For example, the sound 'th' used to come from thorn (√æ), but since that didn't exist in French, they replaced it with 'y,' which is why many old signs say Ye Olde Tavern instead of The Olde Tavern. The 'ye' would've been pronounced as 'the,' no 'ye'"
r/todayilearned,"I've actually been thinking about this a lot as of late. √Ü and √∞ in particular could serve a hell of a lot of purpose in the English language today. It would help new learners of the language a ton to have something that tells them what sound to make for ""a"" when it get either sound like the ""a"" in apple, angel, or ah. √Ü sounds like the ""a"" in apple. And √∞ sounds like the ""th"" in ""that, then, there"" but not like the ""th"" in ""thin, thatch, Thor"". We should have more indicators like this. I don't see why they were ever removed. Now, you just.... Have to know to be able to speak English correctly."

r/todayilearned,"Wynn and yogh went away because they're old Runic characters that were replaced by the Roman equivalents of 'y' and 'w' respectively.

As for thorn, eth, ash and ethel... yeah, these IMO should exist in the written English language, since the spoken equivalents are still used.  Also, digraphs are awkward AF."
r/todayilearned,"‚ÄúEthel! Did ya know, ya used ta be a letter!‚Äù"
r/todayilearned,the letters dont exist but the sounds are still present in the language.
r/todayilearned,Nordic countries still use these letters
r/todayilearned,I always understood that this was also due to the printing press being made in Germany in the 15th century and those letters not being used in that alphabet. At least for the letter thorn they would substitute the letter y because it resembled it closest visually. Hence we end up with ‚Äúye olde shoppe‚Äù but pronounced ‚Äú the olde shoppe‚Äù due to there not being a printable letter thorn. Eventually with things being printed more and more it ends up killing off those letters.

It's second only to fluorine in reactivity; lots of things you wouldn't think of as flammable in normal settings will burn ravenously in a pure oxygen atmosphere.

r/todayilearned,"FYI hospital workers and ICU workers don't treat oxygen like it's some uber-dangerous explosive hazmat shit. Stop the drama please.

Y'all need to chill. The retina damage pretty much just happens to preemies and very small newborns, so we try to limit the amount of oxygen we give them. Sometimes we even dilute room air with nitrogen to deliver sub-atmospheric oxygen.

That being said I've run a patient's ventilator with 100% oxygen for days. Yes oxygen toxicity can happen and cause fibrotic changes in the lung and be dangerous, but if the patient needs it and the physician won't order PEEP changes, inhaled nitric oxide or epopprostenol, what can you do? 

Also many of you know this but I fear it bears repeating. Oxygen is not flammable, it just makes things more combustible.

r/todayilearned,"This fact has always left me wondering what it would be like for a human to walk on the Earth hundreds of millions of years ago when the oxygen levels used to be much higher. Insects were able to grow to gigantic sizes because of the plentiful oxygen in the atmosphere allowing them to respire through their larger exoskeletons. If a human could travel to this time period, I wonder if we would still be able to function normally for an extended amount of time, or if it would leave us light-headed or something with other complications?"
r/todayilearned,"&gt;I awoke to the oxygen alarm in my space suit.  A steady, *obnoxious* beeping that eventually roused me from a deep and profound desire to just *fucking die.*  The storm had abated. I was face-down, almost totally buried in sand.  As I groggily came-to, I wondered why I wasn't more dead.  

&gt;The antennae had enough force to punch through the suit and my side, but it had been stopped by my pelvis, so there was only one hole in the suit.  And a hole in *me*, of course.  I'd been knocked back quite a ways and rolled down a steep hill.  Somehow I landed face-down, which forced the antennae to a strongly-oblique angle that put a lot of torque on the hole in the suit.  It made a weak seal.  Then the copious blood my from wound trickled down toward the hole.

&gt;As the blood reached the site of the breach the water in it quickly evaporated from the airflow and low pressure, leaving a gunky residue behind.  More blood came in behind it and was also reduced to gunk.  Eventually it sealed the gaps around the hole and reduced the leak to something the suit could counteract.

&gt;The Suit did it's job admirably.  Sensing the drop in pressure, it constantly flooded itself with air from my nitrogen tank to equalize.  Once the leak became manageable, it only had to trickle new air in slowly to relieve the air lost.  After a while, the CO2 - carbon-dioxide - absorbers in the suit were expended.  That's really the limiting factor to life-support; not the amount of oxygen you bring with you, but the amount of CO2 you can remove.  In the H.A.B. I have the oxygenator - a large piece of equipment that breaks apart CO2 to give the oxygen back.  But the space suits have to be portable, so they use a simple chemical absorption process with expendable filters.  I'd been asleep long enough that my filters were useless.  

&gt;The suit saw this problem and moved into an emergency mode the engineers called: *'bloodletting'*. Having no way to separate out the CO2, the suit deliberately vented air to the Martian atmosphere - then back-filled with nitrogen.  Between the breech and the blood-letting, it quickly ran out of nitrogen.  All it had left was my oxygen tank.  So, it did the only thing it could to keep me alive.  It started back-filled with pure oxygen.  I now risk dying from *oxygen toxicity,* as the excessively high amount of oxygen threatened to burn up my nervous system, lungs, and eyes.  An ironic death for someone with a leaky spacesuit - too much oxygen.

&gt;Warning: *Low Oxygen*

r/todayilearned,"This was an interesting topic I read in school called the hypoxic drive. Think of holding your breath then needing the urge to breathe. In healthy people this urge is signalled to you by chemoreceptors because of the buildup of CO2, not the lack of oxygen. Breathing pure oxygen for extended periods can result in nitrogen washout that causes lung collapse. Nitrogen is what holds the lung alveoli open.

Some examples of this hypoxic drive was noted in some drownings by experienced swimmers called shallow water blackout. A simple trick of hyperventilating will allow the swimmer to expel extra CO2 resulting in a longer time underwater because it takes a longer time of CO2 to buildup causing the urge to breathe. Since the swimmer is actively using up oxygen by swimming, they eventually passout due to the lack of it but don't notice it because the chemoreceptors respond to CO2.

The above isn't the case for people who have COPD (chronic obstructive lung disease), in some terms they are also known as CO2 retainers since they have higher levels of it. With these people their chemoreceptors will eventually respond to the lack of oxygen instead of high CO2 since they chronically have high levels of it. Breathing pure oxygen will signal their receptors that their body does not need to breathe anymore since their is an abundance of oxygen. 

David Blaine did a feat of this when he stayed underwater for a long time. I think he did a video interview where he said he was training with Navy SEALs on breathstacking and hyperventilating. He was very still underwater to not use oxygen and build CO2. 

Try at your own risk and time breath holds with and without hyperventilating. Breathe deep in and out about 10x then hold your breath. 

Stop hyperventilating if you get light headed, your lips and fingers tingle or just feel weird. LoL"

r/todayilearned,"What they should do is install defibrillators in ATMs (that is, machines you can get cash from). A lot more people would know where to find one, compared to knowing where to find a phone booth. Plus, banks need all the help they can get in appearing to care for the community."

r/todayilearned,In germany central bus stations are still called ZOB. Which stands for Zentraler Omnibusbahnhof.
r/todayilearned,Is it pronounced omneebuhs or ahmnibis?

r/todayilearned,"\*was\* short for, it's clearly a distinct word of its own now."

r/todayilearned,bullshit
r/todayilearned,Dr.    &lt;=== That was a pocket comment.
r/todayilearned,"Omnibus is also the correct term for a bus in Spanish

r/todayilearned,"In Spanish and French *Bus* comes from Autobus.
________________
In Spanish we have hundred of names for the bus: Trolebus, Autocar, Coche, Chiva, Guagua, Omnibus, Colectivo, Buseta, Bondi,... and many more."
r/todayilearned,"to be exact, the artificial word was ""automobil-omnibus"", lit. ""self-moving for-all""; shortened to ""omnibus"" = 'for all', then to ""bus"", and this word travels the world's languages."
r/todayilearned,"I will have 1x Sandman bus, please!"
r/todayilearned,In Dutch an omnibus is a collection of books usually by the same author or the same theme. Like the whole Calvin &amp; Hobbes collection edition I have would be called an omnibus here.

r/todayilearned,"The history of the ""demon core"" and criticality accidents is morbidly fascinating.  The one that always sticks in my mind is this:

&gt; [a chemical operator ... switched on a stirrer on a large mixing tank, which created a vortex in the tank. The plutonium, dissolved in an organic solvent, flowed into the center of the vortex ... which reached criticality for about 200 microseconds. ... He died 35 hours later.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticality_accident)"
r/todayilearned,"What an odd and tragic story. He was buried in a town nearby me. Maybe I'll go lay some flowers on his grave tomorrow for Easter.

EDIT: My first ever silver! Thanks y'all!"
r/todayilearned,"That same core killed another person, Louis Slotin, performing the exact same demonstration.

They called it the [Demon Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core)"
r/todayilearned,"There is a movie about this. I think it was called ""Fat Man and Little Boy""."
r/todayilearned,"Can someone ELI5 how this happened? When I googled it, it seemed like just a sphere of solid metal."
r/todayilearned,"I heard two weeks after he died, a disembodied central nervous system was seen outside the lab. It screamed in anguish then disappeared in a flash of blue-ish light."
r/todayilearned,It‚Äôs always amazed me that a bunch of 20-somethings were largely responsible for the Manhattan project and related physics projects.
r/todayilearned,"There was an incident where the scientists were ""playing"" with radioactive material; the game was called ""pulling the dragon's tail"". They would bring two  isotopes together until they started to go critical mass and then move them apart again. One time the mechanism failed and there was nothing to be done about it until one scientist actually pulled open the chamber door, went inside, and pulled the two isotopes apart manually. He died a couple of days later of radiation poisoning. He was an Orthodox Jew, but in the Pearl Buck story about the incident (""Command The Morning"") he was made an ""orphan""."
r/todayilearned,What a horrid way to die.
r/todayilearned,"Follow the path a bit and read up on the ‚ÄúDemon Core‚Äù. This isn‚Äôt the only time that this hunk of plutonium took a life. 

9 months later, Louis Slotin and 7 others were involved in an accident that included this same core. 

Slotin was the only one who died as an immediate result."
r/todayilearned,"Jesus, that's why you build your pizza oven BEFORE your nuclear reactor."
r/todayilearned,Wtf! He didn't gain any superpowers?!
r/todayilearned,"Portrayed somewhat by John Cusack in Fat Man and Little Boy, except they named him Michael Merriman in that movie.  Truly a heartbreaking scene, well two scenes.  When he realizes he is going to die, and then when he is actually dying.

Except they seemed to imply in the movie he died much quicker."
r/todayilearned,"I'll probably be downvoted by people who are overly defensive. but...

They were being pretty stupid with the cores, not using proper safety gear that was around that time because they wanted dexterity. 

Then again science did a lot of stupid things for smart people back then.

r/todayilearned,"If he died from been exposed to radiation, wouldnt his body still be emitting radiation?"
r/todayilearned,So I go back to the brick...why carry a brick around a plutonium core?
r/todayilearned,Talking about the demon core? Yeah don't mess with radioactive things.
r/todayilearned,"Radiation freaks me out so much, just reading about makes me feel sick. must be a horrible death, I can't imagine"
r/todayilearned,"In all of these criticality accidents, it seems like the radioactive core is shielded by some sort of dense metal that should stop the neutron radiation. What do they die from?  Or does these accidents imply that the shielding wasn't placed completely down, so it reached criticality before being completely sealed."
r/todayilearned,The movie Fatman and Little Boy documented that scene. John Cusack played him.

r/todayilearned,"Nice try, big frozen foods against bakers"
r/todayilearned,Someone asked the question [here](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/43742/is-bread-bad-for-ducks). Apparently it's not that bad even if other things mentioned here would better for ducks.
r/todayilearned,This pro-duck propaganda is an affront to reason!

I usually chuck them some bird seed"
r/todayilearned,Or meal worms.
r/todayilearned,As nature intended

r/todayilearned,Frozen? Can they be thawed?
r/todayilearned,"&gt;According to the trust‚Äôs list of suggested ‚Äúhealthy alternatives‚Äù for birds, grapes should be cut in half and lettuce chopped up, while frozen peas should be defrosted - but need not be cooked.

I think they are just called peas then..."
r/todayilearned,"I'll often take peas or sweetcorn.

That being said when people were being told off for feeding bread to ducks and swans and stopped feeding them, birds started starving to death.

Sure it's not great, but it's better than nothing"
r/todayilearned,Thank Christ for this. My grandmother used to take me to feed stale bread to the ducks. I've spent the last 30 years wondering why walks by the river involve wading through the carcasses of dead ducks. Now it's all clear.

r/todayilearned,"**Correction:**  The ""about 50% more coal"" figure was based on 2012 coal production (1,016  million short tons), as the graph at the top of the wiki article stops there. Coal production has fallen precipitously since then, however. Coal Production in 1918 was 678 million short tons, production in 2018 was 755  million short tons, just a 11% increase.

edit: *million* short tons"

r/todayilearned,"I worked with a former miner recently. He explained the mechanization and improved mining technology that dramatically reduced the need for manpower and replaced it with machinery in the span of his time in the industry since the ‚Äò80s. I was also surprised at how much he got paid as a miner, and how that definitely traps workers - it‚Äôs literally one of the best paid low-skill, low-education jobs available. You can‚Äôt really walk away from that. He did, it cost him a lot (house, community, savings, etc.) but he wanted out and an education, he played the long game.

r/todayilearned,"That is the same issue with Government infrastructure plans. The Government mindset is still stuck in a 1920s where it took massive numbers of workers to construct a road. Today, road building has relatively no impact on employment.

As a side note ... if not for public transit taking 20% of the gas tax funds for the 2% that use the system each year, our highways and bridges would be in excellent shape. They should have established a separate funding source and not stolen gas tax funds."

The percen tages move in favor of the theater the longer the movie plays. But since there are so many movies coming out all the time, almost no movies play for more than a few weeks anyway, even if they are smash hits. That means the movie theaters get almost no money from the actual movie ticket sales.

So the only way they can make money at all is to sell you lots of high-profit stuff at the concession stand."

r/todayilearned,The theater I worked at didn‚Äôt sell the soda they sold the cups. We literally had to count cups for inventory. And if employees wanted to drink soda we had to either bring our own cup or use the little cheap plastic ones.
r/todayilearned,"Concessions fund everything at the movie theater. Drinks are good too.

You buy the syrup by the gallon, sell by the cup."

Over paying for a gigantic barrel of popcorn is part of the whole experience 

I‚Äôm also not right in the head"
r/todayilearned,"&gt;10 Outrageous Markups You‚Äôd Never Guess You Were Paying

Proceeds to list a bunch of stuff everyone knows is heavily marked up.

The text messages one is dumb too since practically no one is paying for single texts anymore and most plans are unlimited so the cost per unit really only depends on how many you send."
r/todayilearned,Gotta sneak it in from your socks
r/todayilearned,Why did popcorn become the go-to movie snack? It's arguably one of the louder crunch noises when eaten. Was is solely based on most profitable?
r/todayilearned,Anyone know how much cotton candy is marked up?
r/todayilearned,TIL food and drinks at movie theaters are expensive.
r/todayilearned,"I worked in the theater biz for a decade.  Got my first job at 14 and stopped when I had done it all and had enough of the shit.  The pricing is based on one simple rule.  What the market will bear.   It's basically the ""rose in a restaurant"" scam.   Either you pony up for concessions or you're a cheap bastard.  Most people know it's a rip off and just pay it because it's part of the ""experience"".  I always sneak stuff in.   Theater employees don't give a fuck as long as you're not obvious."
r/todayilearned,I worked in the industry 20 years ago. We used to pre-pop ROOMS full of trashbags of popcorn. We would fill the machines with mostly this stuff.
r/todayilearned,"Bought a whirly pop, kernels, refined coconut oil and a carton of flavacol yesterday and it tastes exactly like theatre.   Totaling $35

The 1/2 cup of kernels  I used made more than my wife and I could eat.    At 1/4 or 1/3 of a cup it‚Äôs snacks for the year"
r/todayilearned,"what a dumb article. products being highly marked up doesn't mean you are being ripped off. it means you agree to pay for the convenience of it, and the business has a bunch of other expenses."
r/todayilearned,The movie theaters don‚Äôt make shit off the actual showing of the movie so they haven‚Äôt to charge the mark up for the food and drinks.
r/todayilearned,"Local/regional chain called Harkins here in AZ/the Southwest has a loyalty program for $30/year that grants a free medium popcorn (or large for $1.00, large and up also have free refill) essentially each visit. Apparently some of that revenue even goes to the Phoenix Children's Hospital. It's the fucking best."
r/todayilearned,The market sets the price. I don't mind paying $5 for my shitcup of buttery goodness if it means a nice snack during a big release.
r/todayilearned,"So 12.75 times profit?

Meaning if it costs $1 they sell it for $12.75?

Percentages make it sound outrageously outrageous."
r/todayilearned,It‚Äôs the only way movie theatres will survive
r/todayilearned,Just bring a microwave and pop it in the theatre
r/todayilearned,today YOU learned
r/todayilearned,"I think he forgot to include the cost of the giant building, the labor, and all the equipment."
r/todayilearned,"I work at a small indie theatre and we only pop fresh.  We also do kettle corn fresh.  We sell the day old shit, but for a fraction of the price.  Still, given the fact that we‚Äôre allowed to chow in as much popcorn on shift as we like, I‚Äôm always blown away that people will pay $9 for it."
r/todayilearned,When was the last time anyone saw $5 popcorn at the movies?
r/todayilearned,"Good thing movie theater popcorn always makes me super sick, so I'm never tempted to buy it."
r/todayilearned,Theaters aren‚Äôt in the movie business.  They‚Äôre in the concession business.
r/todayilearned,"And the theatre chains employ ""contractors"" at slave labor rates in the wee hours that have virtually no benefits to clean the mess you made eating that."
r/todayilearned,"Not quite, so theatres are actually under the strict thumb of the movie makes. They have to obay all commands by the studios or else the studio will revoke their movie from theaters in violation. This includes pricing, number of times movie is shown, how long it's shown, times it's shown, AND what percentage the theater gets to keep (35% usually from ticket sales). With that little profit margin all theaters lose money on just tickets. So they make up their losses else where. That is why buying food at theater is so important. Otherwise the theater will close, and they have been. Theatres across America are struggling. If anyone wants to learn more or wants proof just google what demands Disney made with the most recent star wars movies. The theaters protested because of how unreasonable they were but could do anything about it cause disney has all the power"
r/todayilearned,I‚Äôm a manager at a theatre and we know our popcorn is so cheap we only count the bags for inventory. The same goes for cups and soda. The employees can drink/ eat as much popcorn and soda as they can as long as there arnt customers around.
r/todayilearned,Most expensive part of the popcorn is the bag.
r/todayilearned,"I know the family that owns our local theater. They aren‚Äôt poor, but they aren‚Äôt rich either. They can have that popcorn profit."

r/aww,"Hope this doesn't fall under the 'sad category' here. I personally find this really happy and emotional. I've been through something simmilar when I was a kid as well. Found my cat on a tree after 1 month away, after animal rescue center called me and said he suits to the description I gave them. He was meowing like crazy for an hour (probably got scared by some dogs) and didn't wanna come down to anyone, untill I came there. It was one of the best feelings ever. He had lost quite of his weight though, but we got him back in shape pretty quickly :-)"
r/aww,We need volume ;(
r/aww,"Cats are crazy smart creatures. We had issues with my next door neighbor and my semi-outdoor cat, so my dad took him to my grandmas to let things settle down. Nemo escaped the first day, and while it took him over a week, he navigated over a mile from somewhere he‚Äôd never been across 5 lane roads and found his way home. I was 30 at the time and cried just as hard as that kid when I saw him waiting in the driveway when I got home from work one day. He was mostly to himself, but he knew where he belonged and licked all my tears away lol

Edit: A great thank you to whoever gave the gold, this is my first time getting this!"

We rushed home to find our little fur lady had been sheltered and the adoption process had already begun with a new family. The vet couldn't reach us via the microchip information. It was a goddamn headache, but when we got to the shelter our prissy lady just flopped limply in my arms after being cold and distant to everyone else. It was good."

r/aww,"My pit loves doing this, as well as holding it in his mouth by the nozzle and shaking it. It is hilarious especially since he knows they can pop.  So he is extremely careful when he picks it up or takes it from me  He gets so sad when they pop though."
r/aww,My dog does that to but the end goal is to pop it
r/aww,That dog is way better than I am at balloon bobbing. I‚Äôd have it going sideways out of my reach by the third boop.

r/aww,"To me, there are dogs, then there are Great Pyrenees. They are different than other dogs, bred for millenia to be flock guardians, so they are very independent by nature. Some of my friends think my dog is dumb because he doesn't play fetch or roll over. He doesn't do tricks. He works. He keeps track of everyone coming and going and makes sure you're not a bad person or coyote.

r/aww,"How the hell the human is only 1.5 years old but looks like in his 30's and if the dog is 6'7"" then human must be 7'6""."
r/aww,No fooling me. I know a Direwolf when I see one.
r/aww,"I like your kitchen, sir."
r/aww,6‚Äô7‚Äô‚Äô - Congratulations! You are way above the ‚ÄûTinder threshold‚Äù!
r/aww,"For reference, I'm 5'3""."
r/aww,What breed is that dog
r/aww,"You're *WHAT*
(5""6)"
r/aww,"Weird flex, but okay"
r/aww,For generations the foxes of undershed have lived in peace thanks to Captain-Kielbasa
r/aww,"The only thing we get under our shed is groundhogs. They're not nearly as cute and they dig up the lawn.  


Coincidentally, ""groundhog"" is my dog's favorite word and *she knows that they live under the shed.*"
r/aww,Happens at my dads house too. He‚Äôs got three or four under his shed this year. They stole one of his sidewalk lights and dragged it under the shed. They must be making home improvements at night.
r/aww,"Ok, we're going to need you to go ahead and set-up a permanent camera and start a live feed immediately.  You have no choice in this, it must be done."
r/aww,"Foxes are literally a plague where i live, and as a registered hunter, the government wants me to kill two a year. I really can't. They are too cute. I wouldn't kill a dog, so I won't kill a fox."
r/aww,It's got to be such a struggle to not go try to tame them.
r/aww,"I love how obvious which one the introvert is, in the back toying with the gate."
r/aww,Thank you for allowing them to have a safe place to exist. Thank you for sharing them with us.
r/aww,Those are some feisty little bastards.
r/aww,how do you resist the urge to go play with em'
r/aww,"Um hi, can I move in with you?"
r/aww,Get them a little trampoline.  Check out the vids on YouTube.
r/aww,"Did Momma find a safe place to have her babies? Regardless thanks to you for not displacing them. A lot of people just see them as just pests but they were here much longer than us and it's our fault their homes have been displaced and they are forced to rural areas!

Edit: also these babies are the cutest"
r/aww,Maybe they think you built your shed from a kit
r/aww,I could watch this all day - Like those webcams they have set up on eagles‚Äô nests
r/aww,Max cute achieved. No awws left.
r/aww,That would be an important selling point to include if you ever sell that house
r/aww,Foxxen at 0:44: He Protec but He Also Attac
r/aww,But what do they say?
r/aww,"Every year I get foxes under my shed, 
they always play on the ramp.

Each little kit has a fuzzy little head,
to each one I say ‚Äúwhat a scamp!‚Äù

Too soon their fur will turn a fiery red,
for now, their mother‚Äôs tongue cleans them damp.

Today and tonight the soil will pose as their bed,
in the future the soil on the roads they will tamp.

‚ÄùEvery year I see you, you play,‚Äù I said
‚Äúand every year I miss you when you decamp.‚Äù"
r/aww,I bet you don‚Äôt have a rodent problem.
r/aww,Super cute
r/aww,I love them so much!!
r/aww,Wish I had foxes.
r/aww,Vote to install a mini-slide!
r/aww,"What Beautiful Kits !!!‚ù§
(Coming from someone who has raccoons birthing under her house every year.....FYI mama raccoons Sing to their Babies..üíû)"
r/aww,They are like puppy kiitens or kitten puppies
r/aww,Is this one of those build it and they will come things? Cuz I‚Äôll totally build a shed or two.
r/aww,Nice.
r/aww,"We always used to have bunnies living under my grandparents shed. They were super cute and sometimes we‚Äôd get to feed them! But man, how I would have adored having some cute fox kits under the shed instead! Both are cute of course but I really love foxes ; o ;"
r/aww,"All I have around me are tick infested deer, raccoon and possums"
r/aww,All I ever get under my shed are stinky ole armadillos with their dang Leprosy.
r/aww,Foxes - where dog and cat people meet.
r/aww,"‚ÄúWatch us the foxes, the little foxes under the shed, for our shed has playful ramp.‚Äù  -Song of Solomon 2:15."

Don‚Äôt show us more, we couldn‚Äôt possibly need to see more.

r/aww,"Thank you for sharing, this made me smile a bunch!"
r/aww,Aww. It' things like this that make me feel warm and fuzzy. Thank you for posting.
r/aww,"You should call them the annual ""Ramp Rascals"""
r/aww,Where is that?
r/aww,"Honest question... what would one do when this happens, are their any tips? For example, should you feed them or not? Does the mother care if one gets human smell on it? I only ask as a simple redditor who hopes to have a ramp covered in foxes one day."
r/aww,I don't know about you but I feel strongly one of them is named Skippy.
r/aww,I find this so relaxing and peaceful to watch... The birds chirping in the background... The smells of spring...
r/aww,Did you use a kit to build the shed?
r/aww,"nice of you to letting them be there.
good human."
r/aww,You chuckleheads stop playing grabass and get back to work!
r/aww,"So lucky üçÄ 

What a wonderful thing to have at your home"
r/aww,How can I get some?
r/aww,"This reminds me of my favorite book as a child, A Dog's Life. The fox lived under the shed with her pups. Such a great story for any age. Check it out."
r/aww,"We get racoons, they're not nice neighbours :("
r/aww,I would totally build.thrm a playground
r/aww,They're like kitten puppies
r/aww,"""Foxes under my shed"" sounds like a Phineas and Ferb song sung by Candace."
r/aww,Where can I get one of these magic sheds?
r/aww,You lucky bastard
r/aww,The quick brown fox jumps over the quick brown fox
r/aww,I bet mama told them to stay inside while she goes to get breakfast
r/aww,So jealous. How do u get anything done?
r/aww,üòçOmg this is too...... Damn. CUTEüòçüòçüòçüòç
r/aww,That's a foxy situation
r/aww,I want foxes under my shed. Do you plant them in the spring or.. how does that work?
r/aww,"That side glare at the end tho...

*what? what are you filming? i‚Äôd come there to stop you, but...i‚Äôm quite comfortable here.*"

r/aww,r/youseeingthisshit
r/aww,"It looks like they're watching the game and the white one was FINALLY invited to watch. The orange cat is just annoyed, just FUCKING ANNOYED, that it invited its friend over because there's no end to the comments and questions.

In a nutshell: cute!!!"
r/aww,"I do this to my girlfriend, she loves it as much as the cat! I can't understand why she finds it annoying?"
r/aww,u/VredditDownloader
r/aww,‚ÄúSo ur just gonna watch?‚Äù
r/aww,Moments  before disaster.
r/aww,"Obviously personality plays a huge part, but people who wish they had cuddly cats. Start when they're young kittens and cuddle them when theyre sleepy. Like put your hand in a way where they're wrapping both arms around it and have one leg ontop and leave it there. Don't bother them or pet them or wake them up. Just let them feel safe, peaceful and relaxed. That's what I did with my kitten and now over 15 years later he still cries at my door every single night to wrap himself around my right arm. Which sucks because I can't use my tablet at night. Cute as hell tho. Especially when he gives out a big sigh and squeezes my arm harder and does that thing where he moves his head so its upside down and his chin is exposed."
r/aww,This my human.
r/aww,Man I wish my cat would do that...so jealous!!
r/aww,I'm so jealous my cat will barely tolerate 5 minutes of cuddling
r/aww,I wonder what‚Äôs it like to have a cat that likes you. Mine would sink his claws into my face if I even dared sit on his couch
r/aww,"Nara: ""You're my favorite heated bed."""
r/aww,awwwwww thats so cute
r/aww,Can I steal your cat
r/aww,r/petthedamnkitty
r/aww,Watching this makes me want a gf and pet. A real home.
r/aww,U must cuddle her back!!
r/aww,This made my heart so happy‚ù§Ô∏è
r/aww,Nara is so snuggly!  I love her.  I need Nara snuggles.
r/aww,Siamese are the best!
r/aww,Loveü•∞
r/aww,"""You're not petting me, human.  Why aren't you petting me?"""
r/aww,That is so sweet
r/aww,"This is the best feeling in the world. My beautiful boy used to sit on my lap, stretch up to bury his head in my hair and snuggle. I miss it so much ‚ù§Ô∏è"
r/aww,Human... you must accept... the SNUGG!
r/aww,"I despise when people say cats have no emotions compared to dogs, look at this!"
r/aww,R/Siamesecats would love this
r/aww,This just warms my heart. This only happens about once a month to me but only for about 20 minutes
r/aww,"My cat loves to cuddle too, but her claws hurt me. She somehow always finds my (male) nipples. I appreciate the affection, but damn, ya know? If I know we are going to cuddle, I put on a hoodie."
r/aww,She loves you so damn much. You take good care of her. My heart! Lol so cute
r/aww,Oh how I envy you
r/aww,"Thank you for posting this, it made me cry- in a good way.  My Rocky and I used to cuddle like this.  :)"
r/aww,"My dog does this exact same thing!  Every morning when I get home from work, its a good ten minutes of this, followed by her burrowing into my armpit while she's getting all the pets!

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;3"
r/aww,"She wasn‚Äôt weaned. That‚Äôs why they do that, and she will want that all her life."
r/aww,Is this not the best feeling
r/aww,"""You are my family"""
r/aww,Is that a birman cat ?
r/aww,Snuggly human must be snuggled
r/aww,How did you not react??!
r/aww,How sweet
r/aww,Kitties who aren't loved by their moms/separated early are far more cuddly than other cats.  Had a kitten rejected by his momma when I put him back in the bed when he fell out 4  days after birth.  That cat also had a really strong bond with me.  Miss him often &lt;\\3
r/aww,Kawaii
r/aww,So cute. I like near the end she looks at the camera.. like what are you looking at? Then goes back to cuddling.
r/aww,"See this is the kind of thing that is adorable at first but may turn out to be very, very annoying in the long run."
r/aww,Is your cat named after the alt-j song?
r/aww,"I just lost my cuddle buddy 2 days ago. I already miss him dearly.

Treasure the cuddles while you have them!"
r/aww,I always come on here and am constantly surprised by how gigantic my cat is. Im 5‚Äô8‚Äù and when he lays on me he is longer than my torso. I love my big boy
r/aww,Beautiful seal point.  Thank you for supporting the classic breed.
r/aww,How many newts do you get in your inbox a month?
r/aww,I‚Äôm not sure who‚Äôs enjoying it more here but both y‚Äôall are cute
r/aww,Don't you dare touch my belly...
r/aww,Some onee sans say Nara Nara instead
r/aww,im sneezing already tbh
r/aww,which one is Nara?
r/aww,"My cat does this constantly. 

Like, I'm fine with him being a lap cat, but can he just... sit still?!"
r/aww,There's a warframe waiting at your door claming it needs to see its Space Mom...
r/aww,I love this. She can't get close enough to you.
r/aww,I wish I could sit still that long.
r/aww,I wish my cats did that! All I get is their ass in my face as I pet them lol
r/aww,Cutest video
r/aww,Why do you look exactly like someone who goes to my college

r/aww,Awwww. I miss having kitties!!
r/aww,Awww my sister has a dog named Nara. I miss herrrr
r/aww,[deleted]
r/aww,"The cat is adorable, but so is that little grin on the girl's face ‚ô°"
r/aww,Am I the only who thinks she looks like Joji.
r/aww,And I would love to cuddle with you. No offense.
r/aww,I‚Äôd also like to cuddle.
r/aww,"Hell, the level of chill in that dog made ME flop over."
r/aww,This was too stinking cute. The head nuzzle at the end sealed the deal.
r/aww,God i love animals
r/aww,The way the pupper moved his head so he would be cheek-to-cheek with the bun!! My heart owwww
r/aww,"Years ago, my friend had a bunny that never seemed to like anyone, with the occasional exception for my friend.  Every time I went over to their house, I made a point of greeting the bunny.  After a few weeks, this bunny was seemingly in love with me.  He'd hop around my feet, sit in my lap and let me pet him, sometimes even fall asleep in my lap.

I miss that little bunny."
r/aww,the bunny is performing [binkies](http://language.rabbitspeak.com/did-you-say-binky/)
r/aww,"Dogs always look like The Reasonable Pet when other species are in the frame. Rabbit got the zoomies? Sure, cuddle the little rascal. Cat wants to fight? Sigh, settle down you goofball before I have to sit on you.

When there‚Äôs only a dog in frame, that‚Äôs when they get the stupids."
r/aww,I love how he just binkies right into his dog friends face. He must love him lots.
r/aww,"3 binkies and a flop, that's a happy bunny"
r/aww,Rabbits are very special animals. They are unlike both cats and dogs mainly due to them being prey animals so they can be constantly on edge worrying about being attacked. With this knowledge it makes it so much more special as to the special bond this rabbit shares with the doggo and the environment because it‚Äôs literally put down all its walls and trusts who and where it is completely.
r/aww,"Even better, those little happy hops they're doing are called ""binkies"" and the flop is literally refered to as a flop. It means bunny trusts the thing by it."
r/aww,akita* protec
r/aww,Those hops are by far the cutest things I've ever seen.
r/aww,"###DO NOT ADOPT OR GIVE PEOPLE BUNNIES FOR EASTER.  

That's it."
r/aww,Oh my God oh my God oh my God
r/aww,"Lol, at the very end, bunny is like ‚ÄúHEY!!! Ok, I trust you, weird gigantic bunny.‚Äù Dog sniffs like he‚Äôs thinking ‚Äúoh geez! :) small hopping potato needs a heckling rest‚Äù"
r/aww,Is the bunnies name Einstein? Because his hairdo reminds me of a mad scientist
r/aww,"This reminds me so much of my bunny that passed away a few years back.  We adopted her from the humane society and she has been neglected and mistreated before we got her so she was extremely skittish.  It took her a loooong time to get used to us.  Eventually she did and, while she wasn‚Äôt generally the cuddly type because of the past trauma she dealt with, you could tell she was ok with us.  She would jump onto the foot of my bed while I was sleeping (bedroom was rabbit proofed and she was sometimes allowed there at night.) She was a HUGE bunny so definitely felt her there.  She‚Äôd be standing up and then INSTANTLY be flopped over.  I could never figure out how a giant animal could flop over so fast without making the slightest bump on the bed.  Swift and gentle giant.  I miss her a lot."
r/aww,[deleted]
r/aww,"Where I grew up, buns would lay like this in my back yard in the evening. I guess it was a very safe bun environment."
r/aww,"I showed this to my wife and she said and I quote ""what's up with that bunny? Looks like Einstein! No, no Bernie Sanders! ....Bunny Sanders!"""
r/aww,"Holy cow, a rabbit video on r/aww that actually shows a well cared for rabbit. 

It‚Äôs a miracle."
r/aww,awwww
r/aww,Hippity hoppity Easter's on its way
r/aww,That‚Äôs precious üôÇ‚ô•Ô∏è
r/aww,That was so sweet I now have cavities
r/aww,"I love how the dog seems to notice too like ""oh you showed me your tummy, I will lay next to you now. I am glad you are comfortable""."
r/aww,That is just beautiful.
r/aww,Crying in the club rn
r/aww,It‚Äôs called a binky!!! My little homey Professor Wiggles used to do them all the time as an expression of joy.  I didn‚Äôt have that awesome dog for him to chill with but we still had a good time ;)
r/aww,"Also, that kind of jump is called a ‚Äúbinky‚Äù and indicates joy and happiness. This is a very well looked after bunny."
r/aww,"Shibe is like ‚Äúare ya done yet, I would like to sleep now‚Äù"
r/aww,This is easily the cutest thing I‚Äôve seen in a long time omg
r/aww,To be honest this is the cutest thing i‚Äôve ever seen
r/aww,Is that an Akita Inu?
r/aww,I flop over for this bunny!!
r/aww,r/rimjob_steve
r/aww,Those binkies!!! Such a happy bun
r/aww,I wish I had the patience of your dog...
r/aww,These people got a husky AND a bunny? lucky
r/aww,"This is the most ""aww"" thing Ive seen in r/aww"
r/aww,Dog: This strange hopping cat keeps waking me up.
r/aww,"let's play, dog!

no, let's not.  Ever hear the saying, let sleeping dogs lie?

OK. {flop} Nap now, play later, dog."
r/aww,I had no idea. I just adopted a bunny Thursday and the next day I found her just flopped on her side. She does it when people are around. I would have thought that she will be hiding all day long. She‚Äôs actually really friendly and he only thing she doesn‚Äôt like is to be picked up (we only did that twice to transfer cages).
r/aww,"/r/eyebleach, this one right here."
r/aww,That's the cutest fucking thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
r/aww,"When me and ny ex had bunnies, the two adult female bunnies would do that, and the one that was a mom probably did it due to being tired. I never knew they did that when relaxed, i guess our bunnies were really relaxed a lot?"
r/aww,God this is the cutest thing I saw all day. The bunny is so happy. You can tell by those little fluttery jumps he is doing. They‚Äôre called binkies. And bunnies do those when they are very happy/content. And yes the final flop in the end is that of total trust and comfort.
r/aww,true friendship conquers all .... the dog is mad chill
r/aww,"Pumas still have a little kitten's heart, haven't they?"
r/aww,"Messi!  I love that cat!  Poor baby is a tiny male compared to what he's supposed to be.  He can't be released because he'd be killed by other males, he'd have no chance.  He was extremely sick as a child and it stunted his growth.  He's a sweetie!"
r/aww,Well this seems just slightly unsafe...
r/aww,I feel like a headbutt from a cat that size would hurt!
r/aww,Bed time story and midnight snack.
r/aww,It would be so cool but equally terrifying to have a big cat as a pet. Cats are assholes but at least right now worst thing that happens is a tiny scratch. Big cat = not so tiny scratch
r/aww,r/cutebuthorrifying
r/aww,And then an hour later It heard a strange noise and knocked a door off the hinge.
r/aww,That's Steve French!

r/aww,"Why there is a puma in someone‚Äôs house? 0_0
Am I missing something here?"
r/aww,What kind of dog is this?
r/aww,Think she has a giant litter box in the basement?  Or does he walk her like a dog?
r/aww,"When a house cat tries to take up an excess amount of space in the bed, you cuddle it. When this thing tries that, you take your place on the couch."
r/aww,"This is the cat version of salt and peppering your food before consumption.

Beautiful cat though and looks well fed"
r/aww,Is it legal to have a puma?
r/aww,This makes me happy and uncomfortable at the same time
r/aww,"inb4 natural selection strikes again! =) People are so dumb.

Sure. These animals might be fine for a long time. But when one thing sets them off, they won't care for a second that you've been feeding them and giving them shelter for years. They will fuck you UP!"
r/aww,I want one
r/aww,Hey... you know how some cats like to sleep on people's faces...
r/aww,"Aw, he's so tame he'll eat right off your hand. Or is that eat your hand right off? I forget."
r/aww,Entertain me with fiction and I just might spare your life human
r/aww,How does someone acquire such a cat for a pet?
r/aww,I want a kitty
r/aww,I thought he was Michael Santaro
r/aww,Never own something as a pet that could kill you if it wanted to.
r/aww,Murder kitty
r/aww,That is one pet I would feed well and regularly like my life depended on it.
r/aww,I actually feel sorry for anyone who breaks into your house
r/aww,It's all well and good until he uses your head as a chew toy.
r/aww,My question is if this is legal in certain areas.
r/aww,I like how he is wearing a puma shirt
r/aww,Someone please help me out here.  Is this bigboye showing legit love here?!?
r/aww,"I'm pretty naive to think that all these people who snuggle with wild animals are zoo keepers or conservationists, aren't I?"
r/aww,All fun and cute until you wake up at 3 am and it‚Äôs on your chest starring into your soul
r/aww,I want those forbidden snuggles

r/aww,But where's Bella?
r/aww,This lucky mf. I want this too!
r/aww,Thats no shed kitty. Steve French belongs in the wild bubs.
r/aww,Did you raise  him( her) from a baby ?
r/aww,Who else is gonna make sure the job is done
r/aww,"My cat does the same! Except she let's you know you are done petting her by then grabbing your hand and biting/scratching said hand...

It's a fine fine line with mine.... üòÇ"
r/aww,Help I'm being held hostage by fluffy kitty
r/aww,Same.
r/aww,I love this cat.
r/aww,"Oh my, the whiskers!"

r/movies,"This is a fun Easter thing, and kind of addresses one of my key concerns with this new movie. In the original series, Chucky had a personality. Cutting the head off of an Easter Bunny seems like something OLD Chucky would do.

But if nu-Chucky is a robot, even a corrupted one... is he gonna have a sense of humor? Is he going to maniacally laugh and enjoy killing people? Or is it just like a machine that kills them coldly?

I'm guessing that based on Mark Hammil's casting we'll get some personality, so now I'm curious as to what the justification for that will be given the removal of the body/soul swap aspect."
r/movies,"&gt; The story follows a mother named Karen (Aubrey Plaza) who gives her son Andy (Gabriel Bateman) a toy doll, Chucky (Mark Hamill), though both aren't aware of its evil nature."
r/movies,"Mark Hamill is great, and will always be legendary for his voice work (particularly The Joker). I am curious as to why they didn't bring 	Brad Dourif back as Chucky, though."
r/movies,Was he having sexuallties with the bunny?!
r/movies,"Easter eggs AND candy corn?

They're really trying to appeal to everyone it seems!!"
r/movies,*cue Mark Hamill maniacal laughter*
r/movies,Aubrey Plaza as the mom definitely made me feel like I'm old
r/movies,"dude, who serves candy corn on easter?

immersion ruined"
r/movies,I can taste the bad CGI.
r/movies,Great... now I'm going to think he's living under my bed as an adult
r/movies,Obligatory reminder that the old continuity will go on in the upcoming TV series in case you dislike the reboot
r/movies,yikes the photoshop on that yellow egg tho
r/movies,"The compositing of those egg shells is really bad, lol."
r/movies,I'll only watch it because of Aubrey Plaza and Mark Hamill.
r/movies,"Not a poster, a promotional pic for their social media..."
r/movies,"[MFW I get to ""Mark Hamill""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QfSzgV1q5g)"
r/movies,Hamill as the voice of Chucky? Oh fuck yes
r/movies,"An Easter themed horror reboot released 2 months after Easter, sounds like a recipe for success"
r/movies,i see mark Hammil i upvote
r/movies,"Thats a good one.

r/movies,You can tell they want nothing to do with IT part 2‚Äôs release window.
r/movies,What's the tone of this one?
r/movies,"I'm weird. I cannot handle violence like this in movies, but as soon as I'm playing a video game, gimme that chainsaw!"
r/movies,Didnt they also make a 420 poster
r/movies,April Ludgate and Paper Boi? Yes please
r/movies,Had no idea Aubrey Plaza was in this too. Makes me more excited to see the movie!

r/movies,"The trailer looked beyond interesting, the film quality is just astonishing. I‚Äôm totally gonna watch that this week."
r/movies,One of the things that most surprised me about it was how exciting a film it was. The amount of tension and anticipation it creates telling a story we've seen a hundred times before demonstrated masterful story telling technique.
r/movies,I was able to catch it in imax; it was astounding!
r/movies,The real science fiction was the moon landing. Am I right?
r/movies,Still no word on a UK cinema release :(
r/movies,is it available on dvd or any streaming platform yet?
r/movies,"I have been thrilled with the high quality of documentaries we've been getting the last several years. It used to be that we were lucky to get 1 special documentary in a year, but docs like Apollo 11 are joined by a few more that just make for a great year."
r/movies,"I haven‚Äôt seen it yet. [Apollo 11: First Steps Edition](http://macgillivrayfreeman.com/project/apollo-11-first-steps/)  is opening in a theater near me on May 17, how is this different from the original version?"
r/movies,It was definitely worth seeing in IMAX.
r/movies,People complained during screenings that the event would have never happened in real life.
r/movies,"You do realize it's not a documentary, correct? It is still a fictionalized drama film. The characters are characters, not people. It was written, and acted, and staged. Things which a documentary is not."
r/movies,I saw first man... is it better than that?
r/movies,Science-FICTION. Apollo 11 isn‚Äôt fictional.
r/movies,Well in all honestly Hercules was a Demi god...
r/movies,Unrealistic! A Military Survival Expert isn't authorized to judge the ability of a Rock to survive! Somebody get the Geologist!
r/movies,Do you know what would finish off The Rock? The seizure induced by this website. I didn't know CSS can manipulate the space continuum like this.
r/movies,That website is cancer on a phone
r/movies,Can‚Äôt wait to see the new F&amp;F: Hobbs and Shaw movie
r/movies,That website is a total mess on the phone holy shit
r/movies,That goes for Marv n Harry too.
r/movies,"Unsure why this is in the reddit newsfeed, but interesting I guess."
r/movies,"&gt; Singleton became the first African American and the youngest person to receive an Oscar nomination for directing for his 1991 debut ‚ÄúBoyz N the Hood.‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; Following his breakout ‚ÄúBoyz N the Hood,‚Äù Singleton went on to direct such films as ‚ÄúPoetic Justice‚Äù (1993) with Tupac Shakur and Janet Jackson, the 2000 ‚ÄúShaft‚Äù reboot starring Samuel L. Jackson, ‚Äú2 Fast 2 Furious‚Äù (2003) and the 2005 crime thriller ‚ÄúFour Brothers‚Äù starring Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andr√© Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund.

Damn this fucking sucks. He's only 51. Nominated for Best Director at 23."
r/movies,Boyz N the Hood is still one of my favourite movies - so many powerful scenes and great performances all round. Laurence Fishburne is magnificent in it.
r/movies,"Never realized he wrote Boyz N The Hood, or that he was so young when he did it. Hopefully he's able to pull through."
r/movies,"Very talented man, I hope he makes a decent recovery from this and is able to live a good quality of life."
r/movies,I hope he recovers soon and in full health.
r/movies,Fight on John Singleton
r/movies,"PSA on stroke symptoms from: [https://www.strokeassociation.org/en/about-stroke/stroke-symptoms](https://www.strokeassociation.org/en/about-stroke/stroke-symptoms)

F - face drooping

A - arm weakness

S - speech difficulty

T - time to call 911

There are some additional symptoms to look out for:

* sudden numbness -- numbness or weakness of face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body
* sudden confusion -- confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech
* sudden trouble seeing -- trouble seeing in one or both eyes
* sudden trouble walking -- trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination
* sudden severe headache -- severe headache with no known cause

If you have any of these symptoms call 911 and tell the operator that you may be having a stroke.

You have about a **4 hour window** to get treatment for an ischemic stroke (caused by a blood clot -- 85% of most strokes) with a drug that dissolves the blood clot and improving blood flow. The drug treatment can greatly improve chances of recovering from a stroke."
r/movies,"Please don‚Äôt be another Luke Perry, please survive"
r/movies,You talkin bout Shaft?
r/movies,He directed Boyz N The Hood when he was 23? God damn.
r/movies,"That's a damn shame. I love his movies. He was on this hot streak in the 90's with releasing gems like Boyz n The Hood, Poetic Justice and my favorite, Higher Learning. Higher Learning is one of the most underrated movies I've seen.

  
I heard he was going to write/direct an Emmett Till biopic but that's stalled. I hope he gets better because he's on par with Spike Lee with heart."
r/movies,Well...crap.
r/movies,A small solace to be taken is presently the stroke is described as being mild.
r/movies,2 Fast 2 Furious is the best in the series. Change my mind.
r/movies,"I teach high school, and in the last week I‚Äôve seen two kids wearing Boyz N the Hood t shirts. I wonder if the film is making some kind of retro comeback."
r/movies,"As a white guy growing up in the east end of Glasgow in the 1990s, I had absolutely nothing in common with any of the characters in Boyz N The Hood, but that didn't stop the movie resonating with me. It's been a favourite of mine since I first saw it, and it still holds up.

Hope he recovers and goes on to make more movies."
r/movies,It‚Äôs always been a shame that he never really got embraced more as a filmmaker after the 90‚Äôs. his early work is stellar. Really praying for a speedy recovery.
r/movies,Seems no one has mentioned Baby Boy which is absolutely fantastic.
r/movies,"Also, *""Higher Learning.""*"
r/movies,"Exercise, get a yearly blood test, know your numbers and take control of your health.  You only get one shot at this."
r/movies,"Don't forget he made Rosewood, Ving Rhames, Jon Voight, Don Cheadle all gave some great performances.


This was the movie that made me realize that no matter what the setting is, I will always think Robert Patrick is a T 1000."
r/movies,"I have always loved John Singleton. Baby Boy is one of my all time favorite movies. Shaft is truly underrated (Peoples Hernandez by Jeffrey Wright, Christian Bale in it too, etc) and I think Four Brothers is another underrated gem, it was always a favorite because I was the third of four brothers! Get well, John!"
r/movies,"Hope he recovers soon. Boyz N the Hood holds a special place in my heart. 

Plus my Uncle brings up Singleton a bit too. I guess he used to work with him at Sears way back in the day. He was always glad to see him become so big."
r/movies,"I haven't seen any of those films, but I hope he makes a full recovery all the same! :("
r/movies,My biggest fear is getting brain damage.
r/movies,We just watched Boyz N the Hood in my film class earlier this semester.
r/movies,"The fact that it wasn't a ""massive stroke"" is reason for optimism.  He also had the stroke while in the hospital, which means he got the fastest care humanly possible.  With strokes, timing of care can mean the difference between a full recovery and loss of motor functions (amongst other things)."
r/movies,Singleton is a USC film alum and was THE GOLDEN BOY of USC when I went there in 1999-2003. This is really sad news.
r/movies,"Boyz N the Hood is a masterpiece.

The best film debut since Orson Welles' Citzen Kane."
r/movies, Hopefully he makes a full recovery
r/movies,[Don't forget Game of Thrones.](https://vimeo.com/124947415)
r/movies,Strokes and aneurysms man. Fucking terrifying. Get better soon.
r/movies,"This sucks.  Talented guy.  If anyone is interested in getting a sense of his personality, I did recently post an interview with him from 1993, from the press junket for ‚ÄúPoetic Justice.‚Äù  Click on this link, then skip ahead to 1:29:00.  https://youtu.be/h4vf88T0EHs"
r/movies,He did the only good fast and the furious movie? That takes talent
r/movies,Is four brothers a sequel of two brothers?
r/movies,"""Who Dis?"" Get well soon Mr. Singleton."
r/movies,Hope he's ok.  Singleton is one of a kind.
r/movies,Ejecto seato cuz
r/movies,Get your blood pressure checked regularly folks!
r/movies,Good luck to John on a speedy recovery. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family.
r/movies,Has he only directed 5 movies? Can directors live off of only a couple movies in their life?
r/movies,Boyz in the hood is a devastating movie
r/movies,He also directed the best episode of  The People Vs OJ Simpson
r/movies,"For the record, 2 fast 2 furious is the ONLY fast and furious movie that has a plot."
r/movies,It's just Four Brothers.
r/movies,Is **Boyz N the Hood** a good film?
r/movies,"Man, I don't know what is worse...Stroke or heart attack? I say stroke? At 30 I had extreme hypertension and that sucked big time! I thought I was having a heart attack but I wasn't. Hope he recovers. I enjoy his films."
r/movies,"I had a catastrophic massive stroke from being in a car accident.  I was 40 in 2008.  Emilia Clarke was filming her role in GOT when she had two strokes.  Babies, pregnant women, children, teenagers, young adults have a strokes.  I‚Äôm reading this from coming from riding my horse.  I am a Stroke Warrior!"
r/movies,"Boyz N the Hood was a masterpiece.  The remaining works, not so much, but Singleton is a special dude and I hope he fully recovers soon."
r/movies,I hope he gets well soon. He is really awesome.
r/movies,One of Pasadena‚Äôs greatest
r/movies,Man he is pretty young too. Hope he recovers.
r/movies,hoping for a full recovery
r/movies,How did he not win for any of those... ANY of them!!!
r/movies,"They say in the article that he only had a ""mild"" stroke. I wonder why he's in the intesive care unit? Did he need tPA? Thrombectomy?"
r/movies,Praying for that Man.
r/movies,Prayers up
r/movies,Damn . strokes scare the shit out of me. One day you can be fine and all of a sudden your brain implodes and you can be left with half your mind and body.
r/movies,"I literally just finished watching Boyz N the Hood for the first time, this is crazy. Hope he recovers."
r/movies,Aww man... get well soon!!!!
r/movies,üôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è
r/movies,I like Four Brothers movie!
r/movies,Four Brothers is one of my favorite movies of all time.. this is terrible news. Hopefully he can recover and recover quickly
r/movies,four brothers is one of my favorite movies damn
r/movies,"I watched Boyz n the hood finally and sad to hear about this, hope he recovers fast."
r/movies,Sending prayers
r/movies,Wishing him a speedy recovery!
r/movies,Four Brothers is crazy underrated
r/movies,The more I see these stroke reports for men around my age the more worried I get.

r/movies,"Great filmmaker, wishing he makes a speedy recovery."
r/movies,So sad. I hope he has a speedy recovery!

r/movies,[deleted]
r/movies,"Burning surprised me, but countries submit one movie for consideration, and Korea's submissions are interesting. They didn't submit movies like The Handmaiden or Poetry.   
Also, Korea's domestic film industry is mostly formulaic; we only see the best and most interesting work. So directors who become auteurs in that environment tend to work on less digestible themes. One of Korea's Academy submissions was Oasis, which was about a severely disabled woman and her rapist, and their forbidden romance."
r/movies,"The Oscar's seriously dont care about foreign movies, partially because the Oscar's themselves are mostly marketing machines."
r/movies,"**Oasis** and **Mother** were submitted, and were certainly worthy of nominations.  Too bad they were overlooked."
r/movies,I was actually interested in this the other day cuz I am actually half Korean myself. I am surprised a South Korean movie hasn't been nominated. I had always thought Oldboy was nominated until a few days ago.
r/movies,"What you need to understand is that as far as the Foreign Language Picture category is concerned, countries submit one movie every year, from which a shortlist of 9 movies is made. From this shortlist, 5 movies end up getting nominated. Looking at the Wikipedia page for South Korean submissions, Burning was also the first movie to be shortlisted. However, what I'm seeing is also that movies, popular with Western audiences, such as Oldboy and The Host, were not even picked by the Korean Film Council as South Korea's submission. What I'm trying to say is that this is as much a fault of the AMPAS not considering Korean movies to be nominated, as it is also South Korea's choice of movie to be considered."
r/movies,The academy thinks reading subtitles is hard. They barely care about the foreign films that are guaranteed to get nominations so they wouldn't bother on anything else.
r/movies,"People shit on Academy as usual, but thats probably not the case here. Apparently South Korean comitee that selects Oscar entry is more about censorship and nepotism, when some of the best directors are just ignored just because someone powerful has the beef with them and stuff like that.

Its kinda similar how even though almost any year Russia manages to put something Oscar-worthy, 99% chance that Oscar comitee will select something more patriotic/about war because that movie was sponsored by Russian Film Foundation and well, nepotism. People bust their egos even though they wont even get into short-list."
r/movies,"South Koreans do great thrillers

As do Europeans"
r/movies,"It's inevitable that a lot of great movies end up left aside, I mean a single award for all languages other than english and only 5 nominations it's not enough (I don't ask for anything, by the way).

It's important to remember that the Academy has very poor judgement, even brilliant movies in english end up with no awards, the same goes for directors and actors. They are the most recognized film awards, but they leave too much to be desired.

Even if I like that Oscar category a lot (because it has some of the best movies in my opinion) I don't think we should expect a global representation from The Oscars, their focus are movies made in english language and the Academy knows very little about other countries cinema.

Edit: Spelling."
r/movies,Stop caring about the oscars. It is just a hollywood show and it doesn't represent good cinema.
r/movies,"There are probably two main reasons. The Academy seems relatively Eurocentric. European cinema is great, obviously, but that still sucks. It has certainly changed to an extent though. The Academy also often strikes me as pretty conservative, so they tend to go for the safe choice, but that has started to change as well.

Many have actually criticized the Korean Oscar submissions as well though. No Park Chan-wook movie has ever been submitted to the Oscars for example. There are other good Korean directors, don't get me wrong, and some of these are very good movies, but it seems kinda weird to snub such a well-known director.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_South\_Korean\_submissions\_for\_the\_Academy\_Award\_for\_Best\_Foreign\_Language\_Film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_South_Korean_submissions_for_the_Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film)

But many fanboys here also need to realize that yes, there are often better movies and no, Korean movies do not always deserve a nomination. The competition is strong.

And it certainly is also a travesty that neither the Philippinies, Egypt, Romania nor Portugal  have ever been nominated. All of these countries produce significant and great cinema.

4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days is probably the most egregious snub. It won the Palme d'Or and was praised by many as the best movie of the year and was still ignored. I guess it simply takes the Academy some time to recognize great movements like the Romanian New Wave."
r/movies,"Remember, the Oscars are 100% politics. If you don't send an ambassador and a lobbyist, you don't exist."
r/movies,The Oscars are a joke. Have been for a very long time.
r/movies,"Not just Korean movies but the entire  South-East Asian movies are not nominated.  I think this is a case of ""unintentional force"" at work for example Infernal Affair the rights was bought by Brad Pitt with Scorsese to directed and they know that they have a Oscar contender on their hand so It would make no sense for the Academy to nominated it in the foreign film and have the U.S version win the following years.  Think of what the shit show would be if Infernal Affair is nominated and didn't win but The Departed won the following year.

&amp;#x200B;

In the case of ""In the Mood for Love""  it won all major awards outside of Hong Kong but not the Oscar because I think the peoples behind didn't think they could receive a fair vote with the Academy.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  I just want to add that movies don't just won Oscar base on their merit.  In order for a movie to get nominated and win some have to campaign for, it that's how ""Shakespeare in Love"" won that year.  We just don't have anyone who can go to bat for Asian Cinema in Oscar race."
r/movies,Burning was one of my top films. I was pissed
r/movies,"It reminds me of that one comment this voter made where they voted for the Disney animated film over *Song of the Sea* and *Tale of Princess Kaguya* because they didn't care about these ""Chinese fucking cartoons"".

As much as Hollywood tries to portray itself as this shining beacon of liberalism, they're just as bigoted and xenophobic as the the people they oft criticize."
r/movies,Burning was the biggest snub of this year's Oscars
r/movies,"The thing is, not many people watch movies past France which is sad."
r/movies,"I legit thought ""wow this movie got amazing fast"" at that scene when the rich guy reveals what he does to the main character"
r/movies,it's mainly cultural aesthetic and entrenched biases among the foreign-language committee members which select nominees. There's a certain reverence for French and Japanese cinema that goes back to the art-house New Wave trend in the 1960's. This style and their tropes deeply affected indy directors who came to prominence in the 1970s' and 80's. Now these older producers &amp; directors are retired &amp; steering the direction of the Academy to their tastes. The upshot is that there aren't that many American or British movie bigwigs who're champions of S. Korean (or Chinese) cinema. Korean cinema needs to have more of a cross-cultural impact on Hollywood to inspire advocates at festivals and at the Oscar level.
r/movies,"In the last 20 years, the best films from east Asia are coming from South Korea. No doubt in my mind. 

A Bittersweet Life is up there with Godfather 2, for me. One of the best gangster flick's I've ever seen. Memories of Murder is THE best murder mystery thriller I've ever seen, period. It had an absolutely bone chilling ending, that I'm convinced the Danish drama The Hunt payed homage to, during its own ending. And Oldboy is the 2nd best revenge movie I've ever seen, second only to Japan's 1962 film Harakiri. And 2001's My Sassy girl hit all my vulnerable teenage sensibilities, when I first saw it. To this day I get all choked up whenever I see a scene from that movie, lol.

In general, they are very good with their thrillers."
r/movies,"I think ""The handmaiden"" is the best film even made, a 10/10."
r/movies,"Well yeah they don't speak any foreign languages in S. Korea. You gotta fix that first, then work on films.  

Ok I'm done."
r/movies,I'm okay with it.
r/movies,They totally blew it when they submitted **The Age of Shadows** instead of **The Handmaiden**. Huge mistake on their party
r/movies,Isn‚Äôt Shoplifters South Korean?
r/movies,"Oscars are usually and mostly for films in the U.S...just like korean film awards in korea they dont list out and give awards to films made in the U.S. now if someone really wanted to push the envelope they can try to contact the international film festival amd see what they can do for non üá∫üá∏ movies for Oscar award...but then again if the U.S. starts promoting films made by other countries in the oscars they will lose alot of money aswell.....its nothing personal ....just all about greed, money, brain washing for media purpose and sales."
r/movies,Well at least their film board President going to prison has improved last year‚Äôs submittal.  The list of banned directors is gone so lame historical dramas won‚Äôt be submitted as often.
r/movies,The academy isn't the ultimate authority on what a good film is. It used to be. But this is the 21st century. Other film markets should be vying for their own film awards. American films should be the foreign film entries. It's WILD that people still care THIS much about Hollywood while other film markets are producing films that rival what's being produced in North America specifically.
r/movies,Have there been Chinese films nominated yet?
r/movies,You're the one making it racist
r/movies,The fact that South Korea hasn't awarded American films with awards is a travesty as well. How dare they. Can't tunnel your way outta this one...
r/movies,"Burning was the rare chance to give South Korea recognition. Na Hong-jin is too macabre even if his next is a masterpiece. Most of them on your list are kinda slowing down creatively. 

Bong may still have an English movie coming."
r/movies,South Korean films are pretty great yeah.
r/movies,"I think I read at some point that there is some kind of dispute or disagreement between Chan-wook Park and whoever submits the foreign-language films to the Academy Awards, hence why his films are never nominated (as they are submitted)"
r/movies,"Oscars are more of a popularity contest. There are other awards that better represent how good movies are.

I don't know about others, but I notice Romania in your list of countries with lots of submissions and no nominations. The reason they keep submitting movies is because they get a lot of the other awards. Romanian New Wave cinema has been critically acclaimed at Cannes and Berlin, but I would be very surprised to see one nominated for an Oscar."
r/movies,americans dont like movies full of asians ... they have to remake them all. so no point to nominate the asian version.
r/movies,"Now wait a minute, before you downvote this into oblivion please consider;

1) maybe their films arent that good.

Or

2) maybe the oscars are B.S. pats on the back from hollywood elites and opportunities to raise their own personal equity by ""winning"" heavily lobbied, otherwise fixed popularity contests.

The latter being the case, they already arent the moral authority, so why would you expect inclusion from a group that hasnt literally ""paid"" dues?

My guy, you are expecting too much from this industry. Maybe we should have our own South Korean oscars...with blackjack, and hookers!"
r/movies,"South Korea has actually only one movie to have earned an academy award for Best Language Film. It's called AGE OF SHADOWS,  a spy/war thriller set in the 40s directed by Kim Jee Woon, the same guy who did I SAW THE DEVIL. it's a pretty cool movie with great action, but it's certainly not the best of South Korean cinema. I wish Bong Joon Ho is the one to be the first to bring the golden statue"
r/movies,"Sheer volume of movies does not account for quality. Look at Indian movies they produces a ton of movies some good, most shit. Same for Korean and other fields as well."
r/movies,"The Oscars are an American Award, generally for Western Films."
r/movies,"They're not good enough, easy peasy"
r/movies,"There is a lot of foreign film circle jerking going on in here. Truth is a lot of these countries haven't been making great films for very long. I mean South Korea is new money. Most films coming out of it have had hooooooooorible acting and pretty unoriginal stories, aside from a few exceptions. Look at the country 25 years ago, it was completely different. To say it's a travesty is hyperbole."
r/movies,"I‚Äôve moved on from ‚Äúthe most violent‚Äù to ‚Äústylistic violence‚Äù I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs ever going to go away for me, but violence for violence sake has definitely lost its muster to me."
r/movies,"Checking in at 40. I find that as I gain a better understanding of the implications of violence in the real world, I find it harder to justify from ‚Äúthe good guys‚Äù in fiction. I don‚Äôt think this has really stopped me from watching anything but it does color my perceptions of it. The church scene from Kingsmen is a good example of this: everyone kept telling me how amazing it was but my only reaction was that it felt gratuitous."
r/movies,"Yeah, but not because of the violence itself. More because, to me, it just exhibits a lack of imagination. Directors and producers can‚Äôt come up with anything else to hold the audience attention and keep the story rolling so kill, mutilate or torture someone."
r/movies,"Yes absolutely. As my own mortality becomes more apparent and now that I have children, realistically violent films are no longer entertaining to me. I will like some violent comic books, but not the really intense stuff."
r/movies,"100%. I'm 34 and find myself blocking the screen or muting the sound or looking away a lot more during violent/graphic movies. Glad to know it's not just me. I actually shut off John Wick 2 cuz I realized it was just shooting and fighting the whole time. It wasn't ""too much"" - I just got really bored with it.

But yeah I do find my tastes changing."
r/movies,Not really (34 here) that said I was in a car wreck with my kid brother and mother last year.  While re watching Night Crawler the other night I was surprised by how disgusted I felt during the car accident scene.
r/movies,"I feel something similar as I get older. It's not the violence itself that gets to me, but the sort of expendability of life. Mowing down rows of henchman, collateral damage in chase scenes, wiping out cities in disaster movies. I just can't ignore the gravity of lives being trivially snuffed out for entertainment purposes."
r/movies,"Once upon a time I could eat lunch while watching gore and beheading videos on Ogrish.com. As I age, I can't do that anymore.

Horror and action movies though, I can still handle."
r/movies,"It helps younger people conceptualize and cope with the idea that violence can exist. They gain some confidence by observing and understanding violence from a safe perspective.

Later, once you've seen actual violence, or lived through the aftermath of real violence, even second hand, you lack the curiosity you had before. It's just ugly."
r/movies,"For me its cringe/embarrassing situations I now find difficult to watch. I used to laugh at them, now if I'm not watching with another person I'll usually skip ahead."
r/movies,"As a dad, I just cant casually watch scenes with children in peril situations."
r/movies,have you had any real life experience with violence? Military or otherwise? Do you have children or nieces and nephews that you are close to?
r/movies,"I have more empathy now, but I find it easier as I have seen so much. It probably is because by dad took me to rated R movies as a kid. I was telling my wife just yesterday i Saw Kill Bill 1 / 2 when I was 11 and 12 in theaters. This was after seeing Leon and Seven"
r/movies,"Not really. I can't stand to look at car accidents or medical documentaries, that shit makes me squeamish. When it comes to movies though, I like it. I like extreme and stylized violence, but only when it serves a purpose. Like the consequences of a severe action. I think movies that refrain from showing the consequences of violence are more irresponsible than the ones that do not. For instance, most super hero movies treat violence like a live-action cartoon. That kind of bothers me. I don't think it should be treated that lightly."
r/movies,Did you just watch the new hellboy? My friend walked out on it due to the visuals.
r/movies,I was in a car crash in 2014 and recently I had a friend pass away in an accident.. When I watched Widows last year there is a scene that really hit me and disturbed me because of these things
r/movies,"42, used to watch Faces of Death as a kid.  Now I don‚Äôt like gore at all, but I also don‚Äôt like super cringe or awkward scenes either.  They make me uncomfortable but never would have in the past"
r/movies,"It's pretty common. I would say the degree differs among people a lot but especially with more realistic movies like say, \*requiem for a dream\* where all the pain/violence is for the most part very realistic not many people older would watch it more than once etc. Aging really does put mortality and suffering into perspective in a way that well cared for young people just don't automatically have, or block out as well.

I wouldn't even say it's from specific events from getting older, just the overall getting used to actually worrying about your own life, the mindset of being responsible all the time starts to change and increase empathy and even though things might be fictional they still hit the same circuits and cause emotional reactions that just weren't there when younger. Once you've been so used to truly worrying about your parents, career, wife, children etc for a prolonged time it affects how you see things, you can't always tune out things you have no personal frame of reference for when younger.

It happens with all sorts of things.

Get older and watch stuff about family or raising kids etc and that stuff will effect you differently than when you were young. Things that you might have never noticed in movies about character dynamics suddenly make you feel/think about your own situation.

Getting older changes a lot of how you think about the same things."
r/movies,"21, If it‚Äôs overly gratuitous it makes me uncomfortable."
r/movies,I used to think the scene in Inglorious Bastards where the Bear Jew beats the nazi officer with a bat was funny. 10 years later and I can‚Äôt even watch it without looking away.
r/movies,"Nah, not at all. It's just a movie to me."
r/movies,"Be glad about it. I'm sure you'll get to hear one or two dumb comments by friends about it, but not getting desensitized is something good in my book."
r/movies,"I‚Äôm not a fan of gross violence and modern gore. 

I realize that there are enough real monsters in this world and don‚Äôt need a reminder of or display of it albeit a very watered down version compared to the atrocities performed by real ‚Äúhumans‚Äù."
r/movies,"Nah, G.O.T, R rated shoot em ups and Robocop squib type movies are my jam and I‚Äôm middle aged. I do like movies from the early days as well though, the Criterion channel just fired up and I‚Äôm having a blast with old noirs and international flicks from the golden age. I want it all."
r/movies,"GoT is actually great character driven stuff. You just want to look away any time people get on-on one in a dungeon cell or whatever (that's where the majority of ""too gross/violent"" stuff comes from). I've learned to fast forward or mute and go get a snack during certain scenes.

I also don't like gratuitous violence. Even though I'm an adult and have sat in many an R rated film I've realized that they're just not for me. Some people watch an action scene and think ""so cool! That decapitation moment was sweet!"" Others watch the same scene and think ""oh gross, that decapitation was so unecessary"" and it's fine to have those different opinions since obviously none of us are decapitating in real life.

But for as much as I see gratuitous violence as unecessary to a plot, there are a few cases where it can fit. Same thing with car chases--*usually* they're boring as tar since every one is the same, but occasionally they spice it up with a twist or just use it to get characters from point A to B. It matters to me more *how* violence is used."
r/movies,Nope. It‚Äôs all great.
r/movies,"39, and I can handle a lot less violence than I used to. I was done with Game of Thrones at the red wedding. I stopped Last Kingdom after the first episode of season 3. In my case, I suffer from chronic pain, so I'm always in pain and I live a depressing life, so I find myself having a hard time watching anything with torture or too much pointless violence. I need to watch happy things to balance out my life."
r/movies,"Nope, the more (gore) the merrier."

r/movies,I can still watch anything but now as a parent im very careful what is on. Before I would watch anything even when it wasnt appropriate with certain company that was over. However there are certain things I dont like watching anymore
r/movies,"Yup,  once I had kids and seen a few rough things in life including friends die I realized I was fine with violent movies. 

Know what really gets me mad? Latest harry potter Potter seems normal,  then they kill a baby! I mean no warning?? Shook me up."
r/movies,"I'm ""only"" 25, but I think I'm more sensitive now than I was at 15-18. Or rather, I admit to being more sensitive and I don't see the point in watching stuff that makes me feel sick. I stay away from horror films categorically, as well as many very popular TV shows that heavily feature violence."
r/movies,"I don‚Äôt have a problem with violent movies in particular, but I understand what you mean. It‚Äôs probably just a matter of whatever personal life experiences you‚Äôve had, which you accumulate more of as you get older. 

I feel uneasy when police, criminal proceedings, or drug use are shown in movies due to my past experiences with all of those. It‚Äôs not debilitating and doesn‚Äôt really detract from the experience, but I am certainly hypersensitive to it. Never batted an eye before. 

I‚Äôve also never cried at a movie, but I probably will at some point. For me, it‚Äôs just a matter of being able to relate to what‚Äôs happening. I‚Äôve always been able to acknowledge that it‚Äôs a fictional piece of entertainment, and am not overly emotional about it. I would expect that the sense of detachment lessens as the events in the film begin to mirror those of your real life. 

I‚Äôm only 21 for what that‚Äôs worth."
r/movies,"I'm 20 and so I may be too young to talk about this, but I don't think I'll feel this way. Now certain types of violence does disturb me (like the graphic moments of Hereditary or Cannibal Holocaust for examples), but there is an art to 'fun violence', making the story/tone feel super ridiculous and/or cartoony helps not only lessen the impact of the violence but affects how you process it. 

Look at it this way, Deadpool has more in your face blood &amp; gore than Nightcrawler; but Nightcrawler is more sickening because it's a dark movie that shows the violence that really happens in our world, making it uncomfortable and brutal to watch. But Deadpool is funny, the violence is part of the humor, it's not meant to be real or a reflection of the violence in our world, so it's fun because it doesn't feel real. It's all about tone, realism, and story on how violence makes you feel in a movie or any art form. The closer to reality the violence feels, the harsher it is to watch."
r/movies,"Yes definitely. When I was a kid, I could watch the most graphic violent stuff and not care at all. Now in my 30's, I've seen some really terrible things in my life and real violence, and I can't stand to watch it on TV anymore. My favorite movies to watch now are feel good stuff from the 90's and comedies"
r/movies,"Complete opposite. Desensitized more and more as time goes on, and find cheap violence increasingly more tiresome. Stylized action and violence (ie. John Wick) is impressive, but violence/gore, just for the sake of it (ie. Hellboy 2019) feels increasingly cheap and boring."
r/movies,"Perhaps has to do with stress?

I'm 25 with an anxiety disorder and i hate scary movies. Stress and fear aren't escapism for me, they just suck."
r/movies,"Pretty much the same, even the finish moves in the new Mortal Kombat make me uneasy."
r/movies,"Action movies and shows like Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones don't bother me much, and I can still enjoy the campyness of a cliche horror movie like Jason, Freddy or the Phantasm franchises.  That said, movies like Saw, where there is a realistic Psychopath and a series of realistic victims, no thanks!  After all I've seen in my 42 years those are just far too realistic for my tastes at this point.  Also to put it into context I used to watch everything up to the ""Faces of Death"" movies in my late teens/early 20's if that says anything."
r/movies,"Yes, absolutely. When I was younger, I prided myself on my ability to not be fazed by anything. I saw some pretty hardcore stuff when I was (what society thought was) way too young to see it. I'm almost 40 now and sometimes I watch the same movies and I'm like, ""whoa, this is a little over the top."" Or just not entertaining. I don't know if I ever \*enjoyed\* violence, I saw that it was part of a story, but now I'm like, ok, we get it, can we move on now? My husband and I also gave up on Game of Thrones.   


I don't know if our brain changes as we age, or if we've just been more exposed to actual violence in the world (either due to experience or awareness) and it's not entertaining. Or if I really shouldn't have been desensitized to that kind of violence in the first place, and since I've gotten older and chilled out, I'm no longer normalizing it. Or maybe I just like what I like and I'd rather see story development and no longer tolerate filler."
r/movies,"Well, I have the opposite conundrum - I begin to have a problem with watching sanitized PG-13 movies :P  
  
Violence in movies is fun. It's fictional setting, a playground for people to display some cool looking gory stuff. But it has to fit into the world presented in the movie. That's why I'm getting progressively more pissed off about movies like Venom (don't at me, it's just an example) in which we have a killer alien and the violence can't be shown, because PG-13.   
  
That being said, I never liked violence for violence sake. That's why I just don't watch slashers and horrors in general. Other than that, violence is fun and I always enjoy some sprinkles of good gory mess on screen :P"
r/movies,"Yeah, graduating from edgelord-age does that. Don't have to prove how **hard** you are to yourself anymore, possibly one even learns to accept (appreciate) one's own softer tendencies."
r/movies,"Did you recently just have children? That's when it all changed for me. The violence and the crude jokes, I used to love them both but now they just make me cringe like some old guy :/ lol"
r/movies,Also in my thirties. The Hills Have Eyes remake broke me. I can‚Äôt stand prolonged scenes of torture and such. I‚Äôm not bothered by action violence much but horror movies are a no go for me.
r/movies,Theres a fine line between violence to serve a narrative or stylistic purpose and violence that exists just to shock people
r/movies,"Totally ‚Äì amazing to see it stated by someone else. In the past decade I've found violence more and more off-putting. I mean, imagine seeing animals tortured and killed in a film; just replace them with human beings and you have an entire industry. I know it's only fiction, but it reminds me of the violence in the real world. I'd rather just watch Labyrinth."
r/movies,Can anyone here offer up any examples of violence done well then? Not just gratuitous or boring violence
r/movies,It's just you.
r/movies,"I will soon be working in health care and that field is a double edged sword for me when it comes to movie violence. Stylistic violence I can watch because it comes off as unrealistic to me, but more realistic violence, especially breaking bones or cutting through muscle/tendon make me cringe now."
r/movies,"I‚Äôm in a similar boat but isn‚Äôt so much violence as it is... most stuff. I‚Äôve seen so many shows and movies at this point that the excessive violence, sex, profanity, etc... that I used to think was cool is now just excessive. It also now knocks me right out of my suspension of disbelief. I find myself saying internally ‚ÄúYea, we get it.‚Äù more these days."
r/movies,I just find them pointless
r/movies,"Random question, but do you have children?"
r/movies,"I feel the same.  I think when you're young there's an element of ""I'm watching this really violent film that is meant for adults, and getting away with it!""  But when that fades it's like ""OK I'm watching someone being tortured/raped, why?"""
r/movies,"It happened to me. But what's interesting is that, I was able to overcome it (a little bit) by forcing myself to watch scary and violent movies over the course of a couple days to re-desensitize myself to it in film. I was just going through a time-period where most of the movies I was watching were Hollywood blockbuster and T.V shows I guess? I feel it's partly due to getting older, but also partly due to change of viewing habits you might have had the past few years. I believe it's possible to desensitize yourself again by simply subjecting yourself to it a lot more. When all of us were younger, we all loved to watch Horror movies **all the time**. It's easy to think 'Oh, I was just watching these types of movies all the time' when in reality, that was years ago.

But there's definitely more to it than that, because about 6 months ago I made a post similar to this on the horror subreddit. Other people felt similar to me, as they were becoming more sensitized to horror movies as they got older. It's very interesting honestly. As we get older, I think we're more scared and want to feel more comfortable and just want to live a good life. Think about all the adults who quit drinking because they're afraid they're going to do something stupid. When you're younger, you don't give a shit. I think the transition from not giving a shit, to giving a shit is tough and people will develop anxiety disorders in the mid-twenties to thirties because of it. For some people it might be later in life, depending on how you grew up and your living conditions. I also feel like society right now is moving towards a ""Millennial"" life-style where we're more used to living in our own bubbles, away from scary things. I think it's a mixture of a lot of different things and is different for everyone.

But I also think we're capable of re-desensitizing ourselves to horror and violent movies just by continuously watching those types of things (like we used to, but stopped doing at a certain point)."
r/movies,Similar thing but for nudity. Yeah we all like seeing a hot actress tits and a sex scene but for fuck sakes hurry up. 15 seconds max and move on with the plot. Unless of course the plot is about sexual story and what not
r/movies,"Do you have children? For me, after I had kids I can‚Äôt really stomach too many graphic things. Game of Thrones I‚Äôm fine with, but like horror stories and things like that I just can‚Äôt do it. Anything involving a kid I‚Äôm likely out. 

I used to be able to watch and actually search for every scary movie that came out. I think the only actual scary movie I‚Äôve seen in the past seven or eight years was Get Out I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs an actual scary movie."
r/movies,"Nope, not really."
r/movies,"I am exactly the same. I was a horror movie feind as a kid. I made a point of seeing every movie in the horror section of my local video store. I'm in my 40s now and they all make me sick to my stomach, I just can't watch them. Thinking back to my childhood even makes me question who that kid was."
r/movies,"The only thing that bothers me sometimes as I get older is the lack of accountability and consequences even for the ""good guys"". For example, in *Fast Five* (and I'm sure just about every other installment), we're made to root for the heroes of the story, Dom's crew, as they ravage the streets of Rio pulling a gigantic safe behind them, crushing cop cars, civilian cars, and (likely) killing scores of innocent people. Yet at the end, I don't ever even recall it being mentioned because the ""good guys"" beat the ""bad guys"" and Dom's crew wasn't injured which apparently is the only important part because, you know, they're a ""family"". I'm sure those cops and other innocent people had family too. 

Additionally, I read an interesting [article](https://thetylt.com/entertainment/marvel-dc-superheroes-villains-collateral-damage-violence) a while back that determined, on average, Superheroes committed more violent acts than the villains they were fighting. Granted, they addressed this in *Civil War* and even *BvS*, but it doesn't change the fact that they *still* commit violent acts even after at a greater rate than the villains."
r/movies,Sounds like you are in the beginning stages of coming out of the closet.
r/movies,"&gt;‚ÄúI do want there to be a winner,‚Äù Wingard told EW about the monster match-up, before the start of shooting. ‚ÄúThe original film (1962‚Äôs King Kong vs. Godzilla) was very fun, but you feel a little let down that the movie doesn‚Äôt take a definitive stance. People are still debating now who won in that original movie, you know. So, I do want people to walk away from this film feeling like, Okay, there is a winner.‚Äù

Seems there will be a definite winner. I could totally see marketing folks building team godzilla and team kong promos. :D"
r/movies,"If Godzilla loses, we riot"
r/movies,Godzilla vs Kong is also in election year. Not sure what that implicates but I feel like there is fun to be had with that in mind. The social commentary has great potential.
r/movies,Now I want some alien monsters from space!!!
r/movies,Loving the outlook of this cinematic universe. King of monsters looks so hype
r/movies,Kong flings giant sized feces in Godzillas eyes for the win
r/movies,Such a great time to be a big Godzilla fan.
r/movies,"At the climax of the fight, they're going to realise their mothers share the same name and stop fighting"
r/movies,"Prediction: I think it will be a draw again. They will fight and it will be epic (hoping it‚Äôs set in New York, where they can have stare/roar down at opposite ends of Central Park, and in a nod to the classic Kong will climb the Empire State Building only for it to collapse under his weight... but that is wishful thinking) but another monster(s) will emerge that are bigger threats and set aside their differences to tag team up.. then they will go their separate ways at the end .. my guess anyway."
r/movies,Team Godzilla represent!

r/movies,Good thing Godzilla ang Kingkong managed to clear their schedule to star in this.
r/movies,"I love the idea how were getting Godzilla 2 and if no one likes it and no one wanted a sequel, WB is still ""well, fuck you. You're still getting it!"". 

I know people are hyped. I am too. Just thought idea is funny"
r/movies,They should do what they did with the original and shoot two different endings(Edit: Apparently that wasn‚Äôt true but still would be cool). Then randomly show 1 in theatres and when you buy the dvd/digital copy you can start the movie depending on who you want to see win and how that goes down with the side you didn‚Äôt see in theatres.
r/movies,"Godzilla vs. Kong just strikes me as a little bit of, well, a letdown. I mean, we go from Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah, plus maybe some other kaiju, all in one mega-movie... to just Godzilla vs. Kong. I'm worried it might be a little like Iron Man 3 was after The Avengers. It just felt kinda off, a step back and a bit of a letdown."

r/movies,Damn I thought this was out this summer :(
r/movies,"Why is everyone so hyped for this movie? There is no argument to be made in favour of a Kong win here. This matchup shouldn't even be close even if Kong continued to grow after the last time we saw him. It just doesn't make sense.  
Is Kong going to pull some 'batman vs superman' shit?"
r/movies,How do you ‚Äúwrap shooting‚Äù on an entirely CGI movie? Turn off the computer?
r/movies,That's WAY sooner than I expected

r/movies,"There are a lot of these movies based on someone's life that try to make it as a romance, but I'd say Tolkien may be one of the few that is warranted. Tolkien was devasted by the death of his wife and died soon after. In his letters he talked many times about her dancing in the fields. I don't know, I'm not much for romance, but to me if anyone deverse his life told as a love story, it's Tolkien."

r/movies,I hope its good. My grandfather served with Tolkien in world war 1. I actually have a set of first editions of lotr autographed to my grandfather.

r/movies,No idea how good the film will be but that‚Äôs an awful poster
r/movies,Tolkien's life is extraordinary. The man should get the greatest effort by a studio to deliver something great. He should sit as an inspiration for many. Consider that he was already into his 50s when he published Lord of the Rings... it is never too late to do something.
r/movies,I wish Colm Meaney was in more film.

r/movies,This movie looks like another bland generic biopic.
r/movies,lookls like a cheap VHS cover from '94

r/movies,Nicholas Hoult is in it... it will be bad.
r/movies,"Boy, someone sure is pushing this movie hard. Any other year and it wouldn't get any time of day. Looks like the most milquetoast TV biopic."

r/movies,"[I Am A Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZu3sVK3JOE) hasn't been mentioned yet. Definitely fits your criteria of news reports, people acting strange and not understanding what's happening, etc. One of my favorite zombie movies in general. 

Then there's also [Dead Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUlXtobo5wE) and [Pontypool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehq2a8lum_4). Both of these are pretty unique in the sense that they show a rather minimal amount of Zombies or violence and are primarily set in a single location. Pontypool is surprisingly good, haven't seen Dead Air though.

Keep remembering obscure Zombie flicks, so apologies for the edits. [Dead Set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKuOwisw39E) is another, basically follows a Big Brother house during the Zombie Apocalypse. This one is a TV Show though."

r/movies,I saw this in the theaters when in High School; against the wishes of my usually tolerant mother I might add.   Perhaps she was uncomfortable with the implied ‚Äúblasphemy‚Äù.   I saw no blasphemy.  Only people acting like people.  People getting into an argument and fight while listening to Jesus talk about peace?  That sounded like the people I read about in the paper and history books everyday.  Idiot managers?  Violent radical groups fighting each other more than the cause?  Delusional people that only hear and see what they want to hear and say?  And that language lesson happened to me everyday in high school.   It was all there.  I even recall historians talk about the movie being surprisingly more accurate than most ‚Äúbible‚Äù movies about that time.   Perhaps it was blasphemy.   Blasphemy for those who hope we could be better than we really are.

r/movies,"Why is this franchise so big?  Just asking, because someone at work said that the Annabelle and Insidious movies are also from this universe.  Can someone explain to me why people love this franchise? Is it because it's the next Paranormal Activity hype for horror fans?   I haven't checked these movies, but I assume Annabelle is some Chucky kinda doll that is the root of evil for these movies?"

Ratings Board Press Release:
&gt; Rebel Wilson, a producer on the film, and Jon Glickman, President of MGM Film Group, represented the appellant Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, Inc., and Joan Graves, Chairman of CARA, represented the rating board.

&gt;About the Appeals process:
The Classification and Rating Appeals Board is made up of members of the industry knowledgeable about the distribution and exhibition of motion pictures and whose sole mission is to maintain the integrity of the voluntary ratings system. A successful appeal requires a decisive two-thirds majority affirming that the rating is ‚Äúclearly erroneous.‚Äù The overriding objective of the appeals process is to ensure that the rating system remains consistent and therefore credible. The Board reviews 800-900 films each year. Usually fewer than a dozen ratings a year are appealed.
For more information about the CARA Appeals process, please visit www.filmratings.com and click on ‚ÄúRatings‚Äù and the ‚ÄúRating Rules‚Äù tab."
r/movies,"I am posting this because I was looking for the funny bits the Graham Norton Show got us accustomed to, and was pleasantly surprised by how wholesome this story was. 

Rebel Wilson produced the movie (she mentions this at the beginning of the video, but I linked directly to the relevant part). It does seem that there was a sexist biais in rating comedies. Hope she created a precedent!"
r/movies,"To take nothing away from winning an appeal to the MPAA, it's a real accomplishment in the industry, her case and others like it are now, thankfully, allowed to cite precedent. 

Prior to 2007 you couldn't reference similar scenes in other movies to defend your position making it infinitely harder to convince the panel."
r/movies,"Im an Aussie (male) and I must say I never really like Rebel as a comedian or actress before but she just won me over with this. 

She also took on an Australian magazine a year or so back and won (lost on appeal though I think)

Didnt know she had a Law degree. Props to you Rebel."
r/movies,"I love her. She made some reallly good points, and very logical and clear points too !"

r/movies,Whoever can take and hold it.  Same as it's always been.
r/movies,"I mean, at the end of 28 Weeks Later, Europe seems to have their own budding zombie infestation, so it all depends on how well they dealt with that.  I don't imagine America is chomping at the bit to take an island full of dead or dying zombies anytime soon."
r/movies,"In a case scenario such as presented in 28 Days Later, the most prudent and likely option would be to blanket the area completely in napalm (not nuclear for fear of prevailing winds and radiation fallout) then quarantined. There can be no chances of the rage virus ever reemerging in, say Russia or Canada. The short answer, no one would realistically want it."
r/movies,"Just watched this the other day too. It was NATO troops that landed and secured the Green Zone, so I'd imagine it was some coalition of evacuated MPs and Royals, or something - or if NOBODY survived England, I guess it'd be some NATO official."

Honestly, why even throw in the Ghostbusters relation at this point. If they wanted to be clever, they could have done something like Split where they connected the two universes but saved the reveal for the end."
r/movies,"Let me guess, they come out of retirement for one last job..."
r/movies,"I feel super conflicted about this. Jason Reitman is a guy whose movies I really enjoy. But I don't know how well this will translate into the Ghostbusters setting.

r/movies,Fucking hell the internet needs content do badly we get costume designer attachments as news now?
r/movies,Why do the costume designers get all the attention when the real story is who is going to be the key grip? I'd also appreciate an article about the person in the production office who handles the music clearances before I decide if I'm going to go see this.
r/movies,Everyone acting all salty but costume and production design is just as important as announcing a position like cinematographer. The world is created by costume and production design
r/movies,Can‚Äôt be worse than the reboot at least.
r/movies,the House with a Clock in the Wall-Busters!
r/movies,At least it'll be nice to hate on a Ghostbusters film and not be called a bigot for it. Ghostbusters sequels are like Groundhog Day sequels... they simply should not happen.
r/movies,This film sounds so bad.
r/movies,"Lol, inheriting daddy's movie franchise."
r/movies,The director hasn't had  a hit in 10 years. Nepotism is affirmative action too. Sadly neckbeards won't be crying about this the way they were about lady ghostbusters.
r/movies,"Incendies, probably the most shocking ending of a film I‚Äôve ever seen."
r/movies,"Arrival. Denis Villeneuve cannot do wrong. Every one of his movies I have seen, I loved. I did not expect Arrival to move and hit me the way it did. Amy Adams was truly incredible and Jeremy Renner was real good too. That ending man. Denis Villeneuve is a fucking master.  Cannot wait for Dune. If you have Hulu, it's on there until the end of the month."
r/movies,Ingrid goes west
r/movies,"Bone Tomahawk (2015). This western/horror has been on my watchlist ever since I watched Brawl In Cellblock 99. It‚Äôs freakin great. Incredible cast, characters, dialogue, and some intensely grotesque scenes. I‚Äôm seeing this directors latest movie Dragged Across Concrete later today and I‚Äôm stoked."
r/movies,"*The Host* (2006)
Immensely entertaining movie with a lot of heart. It also has a great satirical edge to it. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially if you like monster movies."
r/movies,A hard day dark comedy and what a thriller Korean movie though loved every piece of it
r/movies,"**‚ÄúThe Piano Teacher‚Äù (2001) ‚Äî Dir. Michael Haneke:**

Just started watching Austrian Director, Michael Haneke‚Äôs,  filmography this week and enjoyed this little gem from way back in 2001, starring Isabelle Huppert. The film details a fledgling romance between a sexually repressed piano teacher (Huppert) and a young pupil trying to win her affection.

While the film has very graphic portrayals of sex and violence, what emerges from the movie is the sympathy that Huppert engenders from her quiet, longing performance. ‚ÄúThe Piano Teacher‚Äù may not be as well-known as some of Haneke‚Äôs other work (Funny Games, Cach√©, The White Ribbon, Amour), but it certainly has been my favorite so far."
r/movies,The Master
r/movies,"District 9.  Put it on in the background for a few minutes but ended up watching the whole thing.

I love the documentary style and the movie has some great twists."
r/movies,I saw Ben-Hur (1959) this week and I loved it. The production of that movie is amazing. The sets are large. Sweeping and convincing. The score is beautiful as is the story. I would say it's one of the best movies of all time and its definitely one of my favorites now.
r/movies,"Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. 

Absolutely incredible, probably in my top 5 movies in the 21st century"
r/movies,"Saw ""The Chaperone"" last evening, which is a bio-pic [mostly] about the pre-movie career of 1920s film star Louise Brooks. It was pretty decent -- I enjoyed the views of that era's Wichita and New York City -- but Elizabeth McGovern is really a crappy actress (she played the chaperone)."
r/movies,"**""A Quiet Place"" (2018)**

I finally got to see this movie and I really enjoyed it. It's about a family trying to survive in a world that has been inhabited by creatures who possess hyper sensitive hearing.

The family reminded me of mice who try to avoid cats, and the themes of parenthood and the fight for survival made for an interesting movie that had me invested until the end. 

I'm curious about how the sequel is going to turn out."
r/movies,Certified Copy (2010)
r/movies,"SHAZAM. fun, funny, great pace, great action, with an ice and popcorn  I had a blast watching it.

I will certainly be checking out more of Park Chan-Wook's work."
r/movies,"I watched The Matrix for the first time in awhile. It really is amazing. My only complaint is probably how the final act abandons a lot of the existential themes the beginning of the movies explores, however we got some of the best action sequences ever because of it."
r/movies,The dirt
r/movies,"Brawl in Cell Block 99 - Superb acting by Vince Vaughn, the story is also dope

Prisoners - Stellar casts that lead to superb acting, especially from Paul Dano, Hugh and Jake. Suspenseful and makes you think on who really abducted those kids.

Accident Man - Something new from Scott Adkins, still an action movie but by far, besides his Undisputed movies, this movie might be his most likeable movie up to date"
r/movies,"Shazam was a hell of a lot of fun. By far the best movie in the DCEU. As someone who hasn't read the comics, I found the [ending to be a great way to incorporate his family into the plot. And the Superman cameo did in five seconds what no other movie in this universe has done: Make Superman an inspirational and relatable figure.](#spoiler).

Also, I wish these threads were stickied, like they used to be."
r/movies,"It was a decent Batman film, nowhere near The Dark Knight. 

Loved the ending sequence leading up to the credits. 

The ""battle"" sequence with the cops, armed with pistols and batons, bum-rushing into Bane's men armed with automatic weapons and heavy weaponry was laughable. They would've all been mowed down before they could even get close if they tried in real life."
r/movies,"Alternate title for the film: ‚ÄúThe Dark Knight Gets Knocked Down, But He Gets Up Again, You‚Äôre Never Gonna Keep Him Down.‚Äù"
r/movies,"It wasn't perfect, but I liked a lot of it and what it tried to do. Many have criticized the choice to have Batman retire at the end, but I thought that was great. A sense of closure and an actual ending to the story is something comic book and superhero films really lack. Most of them just go on and on and on until the series stops making money or the development of another sequel gets stalled indefinitely."
r/movies,Batman begins is my favorite
r/movies,"The part where Bane simply crushes the Batman is a really good scene. Bane is obviously someone not to be trifled with. 

But damn, Bane dying due to deus ex machina was just surprisingly weak writing, and the same goes for Talia. Not to mention the hijacking scene - cool but bad writing, obviously there are easier ways to fake someone's death.

Bane's voice although very cool is always way louder than everyone else's, which gets annoying really fast. 

But just extremely poor writing has to be the bank job. It doesn't take much to understand that the trading done at the time of the crime is to be declared invalid, and the transactions made to be rolled back.

I've watched the movie maybe five or six times now, twice in the theater, because I really wanted to love it. But in the end the extremely poor script just shines through, and it makes it such a weird sequel to TDK which I really loved."
r/movies,The film has great technical aspects but its so far up it's ass in convolution in terms of plot and motivations.
r/movies,"The only thing I didn't like was Bane's demise and the Talia twist felt unnecessary. Other than that I think the criticisms it gets are pretty silly. ""But how did he get back into Gotham? Plot hole!!!!"" Why does everything need to be spelled out? He's Batman, he can find a way into an entire city."
r/movies,Talia was better in the Mass Effect trilogy
r/movies,"I realize it's faults, but it's honestly my favorite of the trilogy. TDK is obviously the better movie, but I find TDKR very entertaining and to me has a great epic feel, even if some of it is written rather poorly"
r/movies,"I don't agree with you, I think it's a classier, cleaner Spider-man 3, but I appreciate your enthusiasm!"
r/movies,"I'm one of those few people that loved TDKR more than TDK. Why? because I'm a sucker for a good Batman film and we all can agree, The Dark Knight was more Joker than Batman. Batman in Batman Begins &amp; The Dark Knight is almost the same, I don't see any character progression between the two films (until the end of TDK). But in TDKR, we really see him learn his lessons and count his blessings. We get a whole arc of him redeeming himself (physically and mentally) and it was so fulfilling for me. That whole arc of Bane taking everything from Bruce made the movie from me. The sense of helplessness in The Dark Knight Rises was far greater than in The Dark Knight. Everytime Bane was on screen, you felt his presence. It felt like he would kill anyone and everyone, I'd hold my breath every time he was on screen - that is how impactful his presence was on screen. The scene where he puts his hand on John Daggett's shoulder and says ""Do you feel incharge"" in his demonic voice, I mean - how fucking awesome was that? He was portrayed as this rogue beast and I loved every second of it. Joker was someone who mentally challenged Batman. Bane physically challenged him (and played with his head too). Like Joker, Bane also had some good villainous lines to say, like ""You fight like a young man, but victory has defeated you""."
r/movies,Were you at the Toronto showing?
r/movies,"For you..... 

And me."
r/movies,You just reminded me that Littlefinger was in this movie
r/movies,`It ok`
r/movies,There is something that still bothers me after all these years that I don't really see discussed much: what the hell did the Dent Act do? I find the idea that a single law made by a city (meaning that it shouldn't be able to go against state or federal law) could possibly have so much impact on crime that Batman becomes unnecessary.
r/movies,"I don't get how people think Bruce Wayne would have trouble getting back home from the Pit. The first 45 minutes of the first movie is him travelling the world after abandoning his ""life"". We even see that he gets jailed for stealing goods and trying to flip them on the market, all in an effort to travel more. Hell Batman Begins makes a point in showing how he got busted for stealing, even though the person he stole from was, you guessed it, himself."
r/movies,I always thought Nolan missed a trick with Bane's back-story. He should have originally been a Ninja in the Dojo which Bruce Wayne burns down in Batman Begins. This would have explained his injuries and his quest for revenge. The pit thing spoilt it for me.
r/movies,The first time I saw TDKR was at the midnight premier where they showed BB and TDK right before. It‚Äôs an amazing 8 hour experience and highlights just how much of a single story it is and not just three films.
r/movies,"A huge disappointment. From the overblown story with plenty of subplots and side characters,to the dumbest finale in batman history. It had potential,but it got wasted on pseudo social criticism.
Also it's actually not a sequel to the dark knight,but batman begins. So basically it's kind of prequel to the dark knight I guess."
r/movies,"Nah it was shit, horrifically paced, schizophrenic story and shot full of plot holes. Catwoman was a walking cringe and Talia had so little development that when she obviously came out as the main villian it meant nothing."
r/movies,It is a weird one. Definitely not something which on it's own I would consider a great film. But it does work as part of the trilogy and as the final film. Bane is great.
r/movies,"I really liked the film, it wasn't perfect in anyway but Bane was well done and likable on screen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know what happened with JGL and the ""Robin"" drop at the end of the film? was it just a nod towards what he was doing going forward or did they ever intent on a sort of spin-off with him actually playing Robin?"
r/movies,"I think people are way too hard on Rises and too kind to TDK. They are real quick to point out things like Batman's knee or his back healing but never mention when he plummeted God knows how many stories, caught Rachel, lander on a car destroying it and it was so nontraumatic she could even crack a joke right after. And don't get me started on how the Joker was apprehended, how you can complain about Banes demise and be OK with what happened him."
r/movies,"The movie gets to much shit, while it has its problems it is still better than like 90% of all comic book movies."
r/movies,Dude do y‚Äôall watch any other movies? There‚Äôs enough Nolan Batman analysis.
r/movies,"Ive never understood the hate. Yeah its got a few plot hole issues but so does every fucking comic book movie. They are based on things that would never work out, even ""gritty"" Nolan movies. Get over yourselves, Nerds."
r/movies,Bane didn't show what's beneath his mask.  Anakin Skywalker showed his mangled face before he died in Return of the Jedi.
r/movies,"Anyone go to the Indianapolis Imax screening? Just got back early Sunday morning from it, it was amazing!!!"
r/movies,"I think it might have been better received if it had been the fourth entry instead of the third. It sort of feels like there should have been another movie in between The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises.

The Dark Knight ended with Gordon making this big speech about how Batman is ""A silent guardian and watchful protector"". He says ""we're going to chase him, but he can take it"". The big Dark Knight speech, setting up the idea that Batman won't give up. And then he gives up. At the beginning of the next movie its revealed that he retired immediately after the events of the previous movie, and has been inactive for 8 years(!). Not surprising that people were disappointed.

Here's what I think should have happened. The Two Face plot should have been saved for a third movie. He can be Two Face by the end of TDK, but the bulk of his story will be in the third film. Maybe he could become a crime boss or something, becoming the thing he once fought. You could also have The Penguin or Black Mask as a rival crime boss.  Batman of course would be in the middle of it all. The movie would see Batman gradually getting worn down. He tries to save Harvey, but fails, and has to kill him, breaking his one rule. This causes him to finally give up, realizing he can't be the Dark Knight anymore. This then leads to The Dark Knight Rises, which now feels like a more natural conclusion to the saga.

Thst's just an idea though."
r/movies,"Yes. Thematically, it hits every note that it sets up and connects the trilogy together pefectly"
r/movies,"Honestly, I think this movie shows how too much loyalty to the source material can sometimes be a bad thing.  Bane breaking Batman's back may have been an iconic moment in the comics, but it doesn't translate well to film.  It took Batman out of commission for a large portion of the movie when Batman is what people were there to see.

I like Tom Hardy as Bane and I think Bane's status as Batman's strongest and most overwhelming enemy makes him a logical choice for the final villain of the saga, but I think they could have achieved the same effect with a simple beatdown.  He didn't need to spend half the movie in the pit."
r/movies,Everyone shits on it but I liked it. My least favorite but still a thumbs up. Batman vs Bane in the sewer is the best fight scene in the entire trilogy.
r/movies,4 u
r/movies,"I think TDKR has some awkward parts, but it‚Äôs excellent as the final chapter in Bruce Wayne‚Äôs journey. A lot of people like to bash it because it‚Äôs not as good as TDK, and that‚Äôs true, but at the end of the day TDKR is still an ambitious and moving film that makes for a rousing cinematic experience."
r/movies,Just came out of watching it tonight At Indianapolis myself and wow yeah to see some of the scenes of Gotham in IMAX completely changed the film for me. Just jaw dropping shots
r/movies,"I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but it had it's moments.

The part where Batman goes against Bane for the first time and loses is so goddamn well done. The feeling of desparation and hopelessness as Bats is winded and stumbling while bane just keeps towering over him makes you actually feel genuine fear. I loved it.

Also I'm a bit slow, so I didn't see the Robin twist coming until they revealed it at the end. That was a nice moment too and made me go :O"
r/movies,"I was not impressed the first (theatrical) time I saw it; Probably less than two months, after the second screening, I was wholly impressed (although I would only acknowledge: *'...it's growing on me.')* and then almost a year after that initial seeing, everything fell into place, and it thoroughly blew me away. It was no longer 'that cerebral action film ( w/ none of the Marvel fight-dancing sequences); The 3-disc *TDKR* OST was also in heavy rotation on my at-work playlist.

I'm almost convinced 3/4 of the movie is just Alfred's dream (obviously starting after his departure), of what Bruce Wayne needed to do (to get to that point where Alfred would glimpse them ordering drinks at some distant resort) but failed to accomplish. 

Unfortunately this installment ~~was~~ is widely dismissed; No one's every really addressed why it was necessary to have keep Alfred missing for almost the entire picture .. I'd like to think, likely for reasons essential to the ~~overall~~ the Nolan Bros. plot, e.g. entirely opposite of the reason why Marty's GF Jennifer was left unconscious on the front porch of [*BTTF*](https://backtothefuture.fandom.com/wiki/Parker_residence?file=Jennifers_house_1985.jpg) II &amp; III."
r/movies,"This movie has issues but it‚Äôs highs are some of the best in comic book movie history. It‚Äôs actually epic, in the true sense of the word. Not many comic book movies feel like it."
r/movies,First film I fell asleep while watching in the theater.
r/movies,"If people read knight fall and bane of the demon, they would appreciate the story more. I don't care what anyone says. This was a great movie"
r/movies,"Honestly I can't take Nolan's Batmans seriously anymore since watching the College Humor Batman shorts.

[I mean seriously, can you watch this scene properly anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enOHraf3LEk)"
r/movies,[deleted]
r/movies,"The prison was so bad that no one ever escaped except for a little girl. No one else!

Selina is a master theif but couldn't steal an identity. 

Nolan entered Michael Bay territory trying to make every shot look cool."
r/movies,"Older movies are whats gonna save theaters. Charging $15 to see the latest Kirk Lazarus films isnt gonna do it. But people would happily pay $10 to see their favorite Tugg Speedman movie up on the big screen again, at little cost to the studio."
r/movies,Partyman FTW.  Love that movie.
r/movies,This will always be my favorite Batman. Jack Nicholson...the soundtrack by Prince..dark and dreary Gotham. It set the tone for the string of sequels for many years.
r/movies,the batmobile from the movie is on display in the lobby of the American History Museum :-p
r/movies,Michael Keaton is still the best live action Batman.  He was great and i think far better than Bale.
r/movies,Awesome! Inspiring me to do something similar when I finish setting up my home theater with the new projector (!)
r/movies,"So we all agree that Ledger was extraordinary but dae think Nicholson's Joker was way more entertaining?
It just felt like he was having the time of his life playing the character. 


His laugh was also  delightfully creepy where as Ledger's was more intimidating and scary."
r/movies,"Thats cool that your apartment complex has one, I spun for a fancy one and they had one I believe lol. Also yes its awesome to watch on the big screen, cant wait til they are released in theaters again in a few weeks. That and Batman Returns will be cool."
r/movies,"Bro its a hard competition between Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger for the title of Best Joker. Now with Joaquin Phoneix's Joker entering the contest in October, the decision will be even harder."
r/movies,"Best Joker, best Batman, best soundtrack, ‚Äò89 is a true masterpiece.  Can‚Äôt wait to see it on the big screen next month."
r/movies,"I'm just glad Michael Keaton made a comeback. He was MIA in the early 2000s, then boom -- Spotlight, Birdman, The Founder. All great flicks.

I'd love to see him get back to doing a straight up zany comedy. His first big break was in Ron Howard's directorial debut Night Shift. He was a supporting character, but took over the film [the moment his character was introduced](https://youtu.be/2mtPmJ_quMo)."
r/movies,"The fact you call it Batman 1989 makes me feel old, as I was a kid when it came out... People born in the 80's simply called by its actual title, Batman."
r/movies,Burton's Batman films are phenomenal. The 89 film is flawed but Returns is a masterpiece that sits in my top ten favourite films of all time.
r/movies,I was lucky enough to see it on the big screen when it came out. Really was amazing. I even managed to win a batman watch on one of those grabber machines just before I went in. Was a good day.
r/movies,The first two movies in that series are still my favorite. I loved Michael Keaton as Batman. The second movie with Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito was amazing.
r/movies,"If you're into movies, you should buy a projector. I've been using projectors since the mid 90's and the current crop are able to throw massive clear bright images on a scale that puts every single direct view screen to shame. I currently have a 55"" direct view and a 100"" projection screen that drops down in front of it when needed although previously I've gone as big as 200"". Films need scale."
r/movies,This happened to me with the original Superman at a local theatre‚ÄîI‚Äôm 34 so I remember catching Batman but damn watching Donners Superman on the big screen was a completely different experience!
r/movies,"Still easily the best Batman film, a great film and is the one flick I have watched more times than any other. 

Have a very personal connection to how keaton played batman in the movie"
r/movies,"My dad snuck us into this movie when it released (it was sold out for weeks and weeks at the time), he bought 3 tickets for Ghostbusters II and then we just walked into the Batman theater to see if we happened to find 3 empty seats....sure enough we did, 1st row, so as a 9 year old I got to watch the first Batman on the big screen, looking basically straight up at the movie.    It was uncomfortable, but also awesome."
r/movies,"Best Batman movie soundtrack...by a mile. 

Possibly best movie soundtrack EVER. 

Fight me."
r/movies,"Batman 1989 is the first movie I recall seeing in a Theater! My whole family and my uncle's family went. It was so awesome, even as a kid I remember it as if I traveled into another world. That is a great memory."
r/movies,Damn that sounds incredible
r/movies,"A local place is showing it every night for a week and I almost shit a brick. Booked it straight away and arrived at the cinema yesterday, only to find out its next month and I read the date wrong cause I was that excited. :("
r/movies,"Fathom Events is showing Batman for it's 30th anniversary starting in May. I'm not sure what theaters participate, but Regal Cinemas does in my area (Pacific NW). 

I've watched a few of Fathoms showings. They were all films I've watched a million times, but never on the big screen. See your favorites on the big screen!!!"
r/movies,"Just FYI, Fathom Events is playing this movie in theatres around the country on May 4th."
r/movies,Where does he get those wonderful toys?
r/movies,Lucky enough to see it on the big screen when it came out. Just shy of the age 12 certificate üòÉ but it still stands as a great film. I also think Michael Keaton was a great batman and that Heath Ledger took a lot of his joker from Jack Nicolson.
r/movies,I saw it in the theaters opening weekend. Fucking amazing experience.
r/movies,I watched that religiously as a first grader. I‚Äôd just stay up all night and watch it over and over
r/movies,I will probably get shit on for this but.... This is a good Tim Burton Movie but a shitty Batman movie.
r/movies,"I will always love Batman (1989), but for me, Batman Returns (1992) is better. Just timeless. Just insane."
r/movies,My grandmother took me and my sister to see that movie in the theater. I thought it was so weird they got Prince to do the soundtrack. Bat Dance!
r/movies,"Fathom Events is showing the Batman films beginning in May. I don't work for Fathom, just a plug considering the topic.

r/movies,YOU ARE...MY NUMBER ONE GUY!
r/movies,"Joker: Bruce! Wayne, nes pas?

Bruce Wayne: Most of the time."
r/movies,A lovely beast *like* that running around *could put steam in a man's strides*.
r/movies,I was 6 when I saw it in the movies. Honestly I loved the Joker more.  But to honest I enjoyed Batman Returns a bit more because it was darker and noirish
r/movies,That's really dope your apartment complex as a theater. Want to go in depth and share some details about the theater? How big? How many seats? Stuff like that
r/movies,How much did you pay to rent?
r/movies,"I saw Burton's Batman in a theater as an adult at release and after- still thought it was just hokey, cartoonish stupidity. Almost all of Burton's films strike me as vapid; I was never a big fan. 

Haven't seen it since The Dark Knight was released on blu-ray. Maybe it's better now that we have more films in this genre to compare it to- I doubt it though and not too enthusiastic to re-investigate."
r/movies,"Good for you... Next, Batman returns"
r/movies,"I did see it in cinema's in 1989 at 8 years old. I ran out crying when Joker fried that guy to a crisp with the fake ring (spoiler alert!). 

My favourite Batman movie till this day! The 60's version is a close second, but that has more to do with the childhood nostalgia I have for that movie."
r/movies,"My best cinema experiences have been with rescreenings of old films. I think what helps is that you're in a room with fans, or at least people who have an interest in the film. Annoyances from other audience members are at a minimum and everyone really gets invested in the movie in a deeper way than new releases."
r/movies,I am reminded of the batmania that ensued when this film was released. Merchandise EVERYWHERE.
r/movies,For everyone else.  Fathom is doing a 30th anniversary showing soon so it will be available in a lot of theaters.
r/movies,I wish I could see what others see with that movie. I just don't get it.
r/movies,I've seen all three Batman actors. Each one of them I thought were great. However the best fight seen EVER was BvS fight scene. When Batman busted up those thugs in the warehouse while saving Martha Kent was fucking awesome!!!
r/movies,Most tolerable Burton film. Alot of overrated others..
r/movies,I swear they‚Äôve been tryna make this since 2007
r/movies,"Aw, shit. Here we go again."
r/movies,"That sucks, I was really excited about what was billed as a grim, dark take on a guy who runs around in fur underwear."
r/movies,Oh no
r/movies,I guess the power of grayskull isn't all that powerful
r/movies,Damn. I would love to see it
r/movies,"And right after they cast that guy I've never heard of to play He-man, too. Shame."
r/movies,I don‚Äôt understand why they want to do a live-action movie so badly when they could easily do a show like She-Ra ‚Äò18 and make a ton of money off that. The crossover potential alone would be fucking nuts.
r/movies,Probably fighting over whether to make it properly or to make it awful.  Usually the awful people win out and when the film bombs they're promptly promoted.
r/movies,Will it cross over with Thundercats? No point otherwise.
r/movies,As usual then.
r/movies,"There's a window of opportunity to capitalize on the nostalgia of this property.  If they keep pushing, they're going to miss it."
r/movies,"I thought the filming was delayed, but it's just a release date delay that we all knew was coming."
r/movies,"SONY

DO NOT MAKE THIS MOVIE

YOU WILL LOSE MONEY"
r/movies,"His score is also fantastic for Uncharted 4, if you haven‚Äôt listened to it."
r/movies,Taking a Stand is probably my favorite MCU theme. Guardians theme is probably a close second.
r/movies,"His work on TWS is fantastic. Listening to the score on its own, it's a little bit disjointed, and what I mean by that is that it's not really fun to listen to in sequence. It's a lot like the Terminator 2 score. An eclectic collection of really interesting percussions, with some awesome brass and horn work. Both may not be fun to listen to as they are tracked on their released albums, but I think what is put in your ear perfectly matches and enhances everything that you see on screen.     End of Line has a lot of emotion.

I do feel his score for Civil War was a slight step down, but it doesn't help that it's kind of buried behind a lot of the film if that makes sense. It's quite quiet in the final mix outside of a couple times you hear Black Panthers theme, the helicopter stop scene, and Tony suiting up on the chopper.  You can hear that Winter Soldier theme when Bucky escapes containment, but it's so quiet compared to TWS."
r/movies,Did anyone else's brain automatically read 'Hugh Jackman' at first?
r/movies,"I really loved the contrast of the deep horn for Cap and that high pitched ring for Bucky during their fights, really cool."
r/movies,The Sam Jackson SUV scene in Winter Soldier always stood out to me. The score during it definitely elevated the scene to a new level.
r/movies,I have the whole Civil War soundtrack on my phone. My favorite is Clash right at the end when Bucky gets his arm blown off. Beautiful music.
r/movies,"I LOVED his TWS soundtrack. I still regularly listen to tracks like:

* [Taking a Stand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHyO8ztfE8k&amp;list=PLBqwoNRuBDz-UP4LWoSh3bofnpjePUlKV&amp;index=9) (A+++)
* [End of the Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V_uTpTNKvY&amp;list=PLBqwoNRuBDz-UP4LWoSh3bofnpjePUlKV&amp;index=17)
* [Captain America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhKHt85CFwI&amp;list=PLBqwoNRuBDz-UP4LWoSh3bofnpjePUlKV&amp;index=18)

Civil War was not quite so memorable to me, unfortunately. Probably because I wanted the motif from Taking a Stand/Captain America to reappear more obviously and was disappointed by that, haha!"
r/movies,"Hell yeah, [*Lemurian Star*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNurbspsdvw) is one of my favourite themes. (It's from *Winter Soldier*, when Cap is silently incapacitating the militia on the ship. It's more of an action-heavy variation on Cap's theme throughout the movie, called [*Taking a Stand*.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHyO8ztfE8k).)"
r/movies,I still get goosebumps thinking about the triumphant music when Cap stops the helicopter with his bare hands in Civil War
r/movies,I cant recall a single memorable score from the 3 films.
r/movies,"Taking a stand is a great tunes, I‚Äôve liked Jackman since the magneto theme and sub rising from X-Men first class"
r/movies,"I really love all the sort of weird, minimalist stuff that he used for Bucky"
r/movies,Really? I can't remember any of the themes. They're forgettable.
r/movies,His music is not very memorable. He just doesn‚Äôt have an ear for themes.
r/movies,The Winter Soldier's theme is probably my favorite piece of music from the MCU. I wished he had incorporated it more into Civil War.
r/movies,"I just rewatched The Winter Soldier and god damn the score just elevates every scene. My favorites are the Lemurian Star, Captain America, and Taking a Stand."
r/movies,Off-topic note: he's doing the score for Detective Pikachu! I'm really excited to hear it in action.
r/movies,[deleted]
r/movies,I just watched winter soldier two days ago and I remember none of the music

r/videos,"Honestly Carl, just fuck off for once mate."
r/videos,I wonder how many entire cigarettes this guy has smoked backwards in a night.
r/videos,He's not drunk he is fucked up though
r/videos,"fuck me. got wasted a couple months back. ended up blacking out and getting kicked out but the last thing I remember I was at the coat check but had lost my ticket. nothing else was in the pocket i had kept it in so i just kept reaching in and grasping at nothing and then presenting ""it"" to the coat-check lady. I couldn't understand why she wasn't accepting my handful of nothing and kept reaching back and handing her nothing until my friends ushered me out into the cold. going back the next day to get it was so embarrassing lol."
r/videos,"THAT'S NOT AN ID... HAhaheheh... SHARPLE THATS NOT YOUR FUCKIN ID. THAT'S NOT YOUR ID, THAT'S NOT YOUR ID ISSA PAIR O KEYS. THATS KEYS. THATS KEYS. SHARPLE THATS NOT AN ID THATS A PAIR O KEYS. Sorry mate, sorry about that. SHARPLE... SHARPLE, THATS NOT YOUR ID. THATS YOUR CAR KEYS. U FOKIN IDIOT. TH-IZUH-ZUH IS THAT A REAL ID...

r/videos,"You know, for someone who's drunk enough to mistake his keys for his ID, he's actually doing a pretty good job of holding it together. He's not wobbling, slurring his words, or getting visibly frustrated. 

But fuck me is it funny to watch his friend literally scream into his face that those are his keys. I mean, he's looking right past them."

r/videos,Classic CFL camera angle:  End zone shot that shows the surrounding suburb homes. (0:36)
r/videos,I'm still trying to figure out how the fuck the ball just stuck there. This is like when physicists say that quantum mechanics breaks down at some point and the math just doesn't make any sense.
r/videos,/r/cfl is leaking and i like it
r/videos,"Was at that game, wild catch, needed more brewski's after this"
r/videos,"What‚Äôs with the goal post being at the front of the end zone? 

What happens when the ball is on the one yard line, do they just play around the post? Do they have to throw around it on a pass play?"
r/videos,Quite possibly the best throw of all time.
r/videos,TIL the peg has a football team

r/videos,4 people + one pizza =/= half eaten pizza
r/videos,"I actually ordered from Pizza Boli's once and they were using this box, if not a very similar rip off of the box"
r/videos,"You could still do that with a normal box, you just need scissors."
r/videos,"No it's not unfortunate, it's just a bad idea."
r/videos,At no point would I ever use that box that way.
r/videos,Have those in finland
r/videos,"Pi pizza in DC uses a similar, if not the same, design."
r/videos,"They tried pitching this on Shark Tank. Did not go over well, for most of the reasons already stated by others."
r/videos,If it had cost 1 penny less per box (to the company) than the regular boxes -- then it would have been a thing.
r/videos,"This shit didn't take off because who the fuck has enough people to warrant needing 4 ""plates"" and puts the rest in the fridge? dafuq you think this is? BECAUSE IT'S NOT THIS."
r/videos,Amicis in the Bay Area uses these boxes I believe.
r/videos,"This clearly costs more than a normal pizza box. Not to be too pessimistic, but why would a company use this instead of a cheaper alternative? I'm not saying that there aren't obvious benefits, I'm talking about in the world we live in, no executives are going to make the decision to cut into their bottom line to be more eco friendly. Unfortunately, that's just how it goes, the only thing that's going to drive companies to using clean alternatives is laws (unlikely, and even if so, not enforced) or cost being lower."
r/videos,QuikTrip uses these for their pizzas.
r/videos,"If people are interested in smartly-designed and environmentally-friendly pizza box designs, [Zume Pizza has a cool one](https://designawards.core77.com/Packaging/62804/Zume-Pizza-Pizza-Pod).

* Oils and grease can be washed off

* Biodegradable and compostable (although with the latter, there's generally very few waste/recycling centers that have a compostable option for plastic-like materials, since it requires a very specific process)

* Space-efficient for storage

* Requires less material to make."
r/videos,There is classic arcade near me that uses these boxes. They are pretty awesome and are super easy.
r/videos,"So close with that Slogan, it should have been ""Saving the environment one pie at a time."" Would'a rolled off the tongue so nicely."
r/videos,"It's novel, but no one would use this, and it wouldn't be prevalent enough that by the time someone did do this, you'd already have paper plates, dishes, etc that you'd more quickly default to."
r/videos,It's a cool idea but you can see why it might be too complicated for the average person.
r/videos,They have these at Yosemite National park!
r/videos,Whole Foods used them for a while in my area. Was sad they stopped.
r/videos,Umm.. that is similar to the box my local pizza place uses; the top can be split to 4 plates using the perforated lines and the bottom half can be folded to form a new box...
r/videos,It's because people say they want to save the planet but are not going to pay $.05 more for a box for their cheap pizza.
r/videos,A new (and pretty dang good) pizza place in Atlanta called Nina and Rafi uses this box.
r/videos,"Well, your remaining pizza goes cold because you‚Äôve torn up the lid.  Duh"
r/videos,I can't believe they got Trump to narrate this ad!
r/videos,"Could also try, I don't know, not eating meat and animal products to save the environment."

r/videos,"What atrocious editing this has. There is ONE part of the song that she has a very well choreographed movement to align with the music  and its the one point where you should for sure be showing all of her for that entire duration. Instead they do 7 cuts, weird angles, and far too zoomed in on her face...."
r/videos,No idea what she was saying but couldn‚Äôt stop watching...

r/videos,Don't need to understand what she is saying but dayumm
r/videos,Alizee gifs were everywhere on the internet circa 2005.
r/videos,"I feel like at once time everyone knew the night elf was doing the Alizee dance. Now people think it's Alizee doing the night elf dance.

It's weird how these things happen."
r/videos,She's fairly attractive.

r/videos,That is the pinnacle of sexiness.
r/videos,"I heard Alizee  was the main protagonist who initially awoke the sexual interest for women, within most men. Props."
r/videos,Mmmhmm. Probably the first time I really thanked YouTube for its existence.
r/videos,"I love the fact that she keeps talking about her ""red fish"" and then has a red fish attached to her butt. I think she could call her pum pum a shop soiled muffin and we'd all still be drooling to eat it."

I always found her music boring, but she use simple words that have sexy sounds in it. She dress in a sexyfied stereotypical French sailor outfit and a touch of red to remind of French cancan.

Interesting strategy."
r/videos,"The song is so fucking bad, the lyrics make me cringe... But watching this on mute was absolutely perfect. She's in her 30s now and trust, every guy would still hit it."

r/videos,That was awesome. Definitely went way further than I expected it would.
r/videos,It's like...too good an impression to really be funny and ironic. But it's too surreal to be straight so it's actually just incredibly weird and creepy. I'm impressed but this is weird shit.
r/videos,Vulpix my god
r/videos,That was both incredibly hilarious and nightmare inducing.

r/videos,That is an absolutely stunning piece.
r/videos,"I wonder if this guy makes a decent return on one of his sticks. The amount of hours he must put into it and its an art form that probably isn't ""in fashion"" at the moment. I'm sure he gets by and makes enough but crazy how fine art or modern art can sometimes be made in a fraction of the time it took to make this and it goes for huge sums.

r/videos,"There is a genre of videos like this, it's called ""study with me"" it connects people who like to be in study groups but dont readily have friends around to accomplish it. I've used it several times while working (I work at home and it can get lonley), it works pretty well."
r/videos,"Excellent work! That looks phenomenal and while I've never watched one of your previous videos before this one, the narration feels very natural and works quite well to provide great insight into the process as you paint."
r/videos,"What the fuck your lighting is insane, looks so real, well done"
r/videos,"It's really great! I'm a big fan of the colours and textures, and you can definitely get a sense for the different colours of lighting. My only critiques (and I'm not a painter or artist at all, so dont take it personally) is that the frames on the glasses seem far smaller on the right side of the painting than the left, and that the skin at the base of finger that has the ring on it (on his lap) is folded in a way that makes it look like he has webbed hands."
r/videos,"Suggest crosspost to /r/artisanvideos, I‚Äôd do it myself but I think they love it when the author/artist himself posts."
r/videos,You're very very talented. How long have you been painting? I would definitely watch more videos like this.
r/videos,"so im a suuuuuuper amateur artist (i rarely paint with watercolor and sometimes do tabletop gaming crafting art like models and terrain) so i dont know how much i can really comment or critique on this piece, but i have been surrounded by talented artists my whole life because of my artistically inclined family so i have learned a little about art.  especially from my brother in law who has made a living as a plein air artist who uses oil.

first of all i love this piece if only because i spent a little bit of time in Morocco back in 2009 and loved my entire experience.  there is definitely a lot of nostalgia happening for me in this painting.  i love the beads, they just look so REAL to me, they really pop out of the painting and into real life.  the hint of modern touches (like the zipper in the sleeves and the glasses) mixed with djellaba (i assume thats a djellaba) and everything else that hints of tradition and the old world aligns itself so perfectly with my experience in the souks.  your lighting and use of shadows is out of this world, to the point where the painting could almost be classified as ""hyper realistic"".

&amp;#x200B;

i love that you you improvised a different background and i get why its more muted colors/lighting to help the foreground be the focus. but i remember those rugs in Morocco, i remember the leather work bags, and i remember the towering bowls of spices and they were never dull.  i almost want more detail in them, even if they are background and out of focus.  but that is probably more just me being nostalgic again and might not work overall for painting from a picture vs being able to paint a live model with set pieces behind them.  there is also a piece of me that wishes that was mint tea instead of coffee in his cup, but once again nostalgia (and i love to see what artists do with transparent items).

&amp;#x200B;

all in all i love this piece, 10/10!  im sure you dont need me to tell you how good your work is, and the only reason this comment was so long was because of how nostalgic it made me feel. im now subscribed to pavel sokov youtube.  i didnt watch 100% of the video, but i hope you could send a print of this outstanding work to merchant who posed.  also, the narration is good, very thorough and very honest about how you could improve things and accepted others critique and ideas.  i dont think doing 40 hour videos would be a great idea, but i think this was the perfect length and the slight music in the background made for a good atmosphere especially when coupled with your narration.  keep up the good work my dude"
r/videos,"Wow my mother used to be an oil painter as well in College and I kinda wish she got back into it because I would love to see her do incredible work like this.

&amp;#x200B;

Your painting is phenomenal"
r/videos,"I think the video format with the narration is fantastic, it made it a lot more fun to follow. Also, seeing your process makes it seem very approachable! My only suggestion would maybe be to list/overlay what you're using? E.g. Glaze, oil, this thickness of brush. It could be off to the side somewhere but I think it was the only unanswered question for me as I was watching. Great work!"
r/videos,Send that guy a email of this

r/videos,"I really do hope this message reaches as many people as they hope it will, if not more. I think the Our Planet series has taken away the notion that climate change is something that may happen if we don't change, and rather grabs you by the throat and shows you it's already here. The level of destruction and the pace it is happening is heartbreaking.

I can't help but feel pessimistic that nothing will change and almost feel powerless in the grand scheme of things which is deeply saddening. I have tried to do my part (donating what I can, avoiding products such as palm oil and hope to do volunteer work this year) however it is a drop in the ocean and I feel no matter what I do a giant corporation will shit on any progress made for the sake of profits.

Can anyone with more insight suggest what else can be done?"

r/videos,"I'm a big aviation enthusiast, and I frequently go plane spotting. If I heard one of these was going to fly today, I would drop everything and book a flight to whatever airport it was flying out of. The experience of seeing one of these flying overhead is unfortunately one I'll never have :("

Okay, back to our regularly scheduled Concorde posts."

r/videos,that kid is so 90's
r/videos,"The Concorde used to Sonic boom over where I used to live in Cornwall (near Lands End). Apparently someone knew one of the pilots and asked if they could wait a bit longer before going supersonic. To be fair it was noticeable, and it's like a double boom. I also remember reading that Virgin wanted to buy the plans so they could build it again, but BA refused to sell because it would of meant competition. So, here we are decade's on and stuck with flying around in slow ass transportation. Like anything, competition in super sonic flight may well have brought the price down so that everyone could afford it. As for it being cramped, I'd much rather be slightly cramped for a few hours than stuck on a plane for another 5+ hours, imagine how much time you could save flying to Aus from the UK."
r/videos,"I grew up in Colorado, so I had never seen one until I was in my 20‚Äôs.  I was fishing a couple of miles from the end of the runways at JFK, and one of these came in for a landing.

The entire building shook,  windows rattled(some broke),  stuff fell off desks and shelves, and the noise.  We all assumed it was an earthquake because we never got them and no one had experienced one.  So we all jumped under our desk. Wr all found out later that night from the news that a Concord had come off the coast going to fast and what we experienced was the result of a sonic boom."

r/videos,I wish Michael Moore wasn't such a massive fucking tool. His documentaries always bring up a lot of important talking points.
r/videos,"I see this posted a lot, and while one can certainly appreciate and agree with the sentiment, and how well-spoken Marlyin Manson is, I believe it is a disservice to discredit the people around Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. It is, of course, no secret that both of these boys were profoundly troubled, but to say that *nobody listened to them* (which some could interpret as if listening alone would have saved the lives of 12 students and 1 teacher, as well as the lives of the shooters) is just simply false. When I hear this, I think of how certain people blamed the [computer games](https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/10/17101232/a-brief-history-of-video-game-violence-blame) that they played or the [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Manson%E2%80%93Columbine_High_School_massacre_controversy) that they listened to, and how dangerous it is to simplify such a complicated subject. I am a fan of Michael Moore, as well as Marilyn Manson, but this documentary from 2002 **is not the final word on the Columbine Massacre.** I suppose that nobody is arguing that it is, but if the above statement is going to be posted (not just on Reddit) as often as it is, I believe that there should be more to the conversation. 

If you are interested in a deeper dive on Columbine, the perpetrators, the survivors, the time period, response and aftermath, there is a lot to discover. The book [Columbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_(book) by Dave Cullen is quite good and very informative and illuminating. I'll also link an article to [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/keeping-kids-safe/200905/columbine-bullying-and-the-mind-eric-harris) regarding Eric Harris. Here is an article from [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/columbine-shooters-motives-2018-2) , as well as a [Ted Talk by Sue Klebold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXlnrFpCu0c) that I believe is worth a listen. The above links are only, of course, the first few steps into the rabbit hole. There is a lot to learn and still to be learned, I believe. 

Also, just in case somebody is not aware, today is the 20th anniversary of the massacre.

Edit: u/vorpalrobot made the [correct point](https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/bfegt7/its_the_20th_anniversary_of_the_columbine/eldm3fg/) regarding my comment, and that the question from Michael Moore was **""If you could talk directly to the kids at Columbine, and the community, what would you say?""** which is the opposite of what I was responding to. I suppose that I have just seen this clip, quotes from this clip (used correctly and incorrectly), as well as many myths about the massacre, posted so many times that I myself forgot to listen, *making me a guilty party*. Mr. Manson's answer is clear and poignant and he is not spreading falsehoods. I do feel embarrassed about not listening to what was said more thoroughly, and I would still encourage others who are interested to read more about the events surrounding the massacre."

r/videos,because nobody said woke back then.
r/videos,False. I saw the movie in theaters and many viewers and reviewers commented on how Manson‚Äôs scene was among the most affecting.
r/videos,"But he wasn't woke. Mostly he was railing against the mainstream media and the politicians who, both in equal measure, appropriated the tragedy to push their own agendas. My god, he's saying that music and TV doesn't cause violence, which is the direct *opposite* of what the woke crowd says today. 

The fact that he didn't condemn Harris and Klebold as toxic white men would probably get him deplatformed today."

r/videos,"Remember watching this when it came out. His line at the end is when it really struck me that ""Shit, this dude's a lot sharper than he's given credit for"""
r/videos,"ITT, kids saying ""woke"" wasn't a thing 20 years ago. 4chan was made in 2003, and they were not the first to use the term.

The internet is a bit older than you guys, and ""awakeness"" has been a concept for probably about as long as blindness (blind to issues, I was blind but now I can see.).

People weren't really saying Manson was awake to things that we just couldn't understand, they were saying that he had great insight on the issues we faced, they're two different concepts. Wokeness implies that a vast majority of others cannot begin to understand things the way a specific person does. Manson wasn't called woke because he wasn't, he was just very smart. John Locke was woke,  Confucius was woke. Those people change the course of history, Manson was an intelligent person ahead of his time, but he's a long way from being immortalized for his contributions to our understanding of humans and society."

r/videos,"Ugh, this video. It oversimplifies the situation that led to the Columbine shooting. The shooters weren‚Äôt social outcasts who were being bullied. One was a psychopath who manipulated another student who was depressed and suicidal. Harris would have likely lied and manipulated whoever was trying to listen to him. You‚Äôd maybe have more luck with the Klebold, but probably not. Harris probably would have just manipulated him into lying to you. Ultimately, the biggest issue was that they had easy access to weapons. Oh, you would have listened to someone who would have just lied to your face and that would have solved everything?

It's a beautiful not-museum.  We took my daughter there to show her what some people believe.

Tried to be super non-judgemental and respectful about it, but it's really, really hard not to be judgemental.  Some of the displays they have are very difficult to take in a serious manner if you're not a believer in that theory.

Science and engineering is important in our family, but it's also important that she understands that not everyone believes in science.  

One of the reasons we felt it was important is we have creationists in our neighborhood, just across the street actually.

Already remember Ken Ham from YouTube around 2009-2013 when the creationist were trying to get a foot hold on the website and many people were arguing against him with very basic logic. It coincided with an ad playing on the site so figured no point to continue because its the same story Ham has said a million times.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/fa90c2c311b843e68bacd5152bca156d.png)  

&gt; Alien Ant Farm is musical group that was formed in 1995 in Riverside, California, United States. Having a sound mixing alternative rock with elements of metal, punk music, and more, the band consists of Dryden Mitchell (vocals, guitar), Terry Corso (guitar), Tye Zamora (bass) and Mike Cosgrove (drums). Taking their name from the popular sci-fi trope of aliens having created humanity for their own amusement, the band became internationally famous in 2001 for two smash hits: ""Movies"" and ""Smooth Criminal"" (a spirited rock cover of the Michael Jackson tune).

&gt; In 1999, the band released their debut album, the tongue-in-cheek titled 'Greatest Hits'. It went on to win ""Best Independent Album"" in the L.A. Music Awards and has picked up a big fan response. In 2000, after forging a friendship with the alternative rock band Papa Roach, Alien Ant Farm signed with DreamWorks SKG for their first major studio album, called 'ANThology'. The band's tunes showcased an energetic sound that featured humorous, often cynical lyrics and a desire to take in all kinds of musical influences.

&gt; In 2001, their cover of the Michael Jackson song, ""Smooth Criminal"", was a #1 single in both Australia and New Zealand as well a #3 single in the United Kingdom and #1 on Billboard's Modern Rock chart. The song's music video features numerous homages to Michael Jackson's life and career as well as Jackson's many videos. The song was featured on the soundtrack of the first season of 'WWE Tough Enough' and in the movie 'American Pie 2'. Their following single, ""Movies"", also featured a quirky music video with references to classic films such as 'The Karate Kid' and 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. The tune became top 5 hit in the U.K. and a top 20 hit in New Zealand. The band began touring in promotion of these two singles and their album, which later went platinum.

&gt; In spring of 2002, the band contributed the track ""Bug Bytes"" to the first 'Spider-Man' soundtrack, giving them even more exposure after the Tobey Maguire film's major success. However, tragedy struck the group. In May 2002, the band was involved in a bus accident while touring in Spain. The driver, 26-year-old Christopher Holland, was killed, and lead singer Dryden Mitchell suffered a fractured C2 vertebra. The horrific event scarred the group permanently, and many fans speculated that the band might have to go on a long hiatus or even fold for a while.

&gt; Nontheless, Alien Ant Farm soon returned to the studio to work on their next album, titled 'truANT', which was released in 2003. Produced by Stone Temple Pilots' Robert and Dean DeLeo, the work found the band doubling down on their past style. The video for ""These Days"", the first single from the album, was filmed on top of a nearby building during the Red Carpet at the 2003 BET Awards. While that tune ended up having more modest success that the band had hoped, song ""Glow"" was a mainstream radio success, achieving long lasting Top 20 success in New Zealand. Two months after this album was released, however, the group's record label closed its doors. Some fans speculated that the outfit had some kind of black cloud of bad luck around them, despite the guys' talents.

&gt; In October 2003, guitarist Terry Corso split with the band, citing ""irreconcilable differences"". Soon after, he joined the popular alternative metal outfit Powerman 5000 for a time. Joe Hill was named the new guitarist in 2005. The musician had formerly served in the underground California rock outfit Spiderworks.

&gt; In 2004, the band recorded the song ""Dark in Here"" for the Punisher video game. Unfortunately, the band was forced to wait for Geffen to allow them to record another album. Label Universal Music had bought DreamWorks and assigned the band to the Geffen Records company, and it appeared as if corporate shenanigans had stopped the band's momentum in its tracks, the mainstream popularity having faded.

&gt; In 2005, the band recorded with producer Jim Wirt (who recorded their independent, debut release ""Greatest Hits"") and planned to release the album during that summer. However, Geffen shelved the album and subsequently denied the band the rights to release it themselves. The band hit the road and made bootleg copies of the album material available to all of their fans. This unofficial release was dubbed 3rd Draft by fans.

&gt; In late 2005, Geffen finally agreed to let the band release the album on another Universal label, Universal Music Enterprises (its catalogue division). On May 4, 2006, information began showing up on music store websites and release calendars about an upcoming release from the band. The band also released information about a DVD that same day. On May 30, 2006 the new album, Up in the Attic, was released digitally on iTunes. The first single was ""Forgive and Forget"", the one added track to 3rd Draft.

&gt; In April 2006, bassist Tye Zamora left the band and decided to go to college. He was replaced by Alex Barreto (formerly of hardcore bands Chain of Strength, Hardstance, and Inside Out). On June 29, 2006, the band performed on G4's Attack of the Show, and on July 18, 2006, Up in the Attic was released worldwide, along with BUSted: The Definitive DVD. Included on the DVD were music videos for ""Forgive and Forget"", ""Around the Block"", and ""She's Only Evil"". Notably, the three videos feature only Dryden Mitchell and Mike Cosgrove.

&gt; Since the July 2006 release of Up in the Attic, very little has happened. Their website remained unupdated from November 2006 until April 2007, the update promoting the Alien Ant Fans website, created by a long time Polish fan, Bartek.

&gt; The band released Around the Block, the second single from Up in the Attic, on iTunes Store in 2007.

&gt; On February 11, 2008, the band posted a statement on their website saying all the original members of the band are back together.

r/music,damn they got Mr. Miyagi for this video? Nice
r/music,Such a great song
r/music,This record was legitimately good.
r/music,I still rock out to this song and this band while I‚Äôm painting cars at work. Underrated without a doubt.
r/music,"They had songs other than Smooth Criminal?

/s"
r/music,"God, one year already?"
r/music,Is time going really fast for anyone else too...?
r/music,"Waiting for love is one of my all time favorite songs, and has helped me through a lot of darkness.

Thanks Avicii."
r/music,Hope he rests in peace and his family and friends had the mental strength to cope through such a difficult time.
r/music,Time flies... You always kinda hope they will eventually come back and publish new material. üòï
r/music,Really suggest anyone watch the documentary of him on Netflix. Really makes you appreciate his work ethic and it shows that fame and money don‚Äôt equate to happiness.
r/music,"I will always remember how sad I was when I came home late that night and heard that one of my favourite musicians has passed away. 
But everytime when I listen to one of his songs I'm also happy because a few hours later my baby boy was born.
Sometimes sadness can turn into sth. great."
r/music,"&gt;He was 28 years old, and was one of electronic dance music's most promising rising stars.

What.. Avicii was as established as one can be when he died. He had been world famous since 7 years already."
r/music,"THE SULTAN OF OMAN LIVES IN ZANZIBAR NOW

(That's just where he lives.)"
r/music,:( I've listened to SOS 20 times today
r/music,"His manager never got the attention he deserved.  As far as I know he kept booking Avicii into shows even though he said he couldn‚Äôt do anymore due to his mental state. Practically drove him into suicide.

edit:
He got booked into more than 900 gigs in roughly 8 years. That is a different gig, anywhere in the world, every 3.2 DAYS on average. Often this would mean finishing a set, then immediately jumping onto a plane to fly halfway around the globe for your next gig. Sounds like the life of a rockstar but that stuff wears you out really quick."
r/music,"The BBC essential mix they did in tribute last year was really good.  
https://www.mixcloud.com/corenewsuploads/avicii-essential-mix-2018-04-28/"
r/music,I thought I mistakenly sorted by controversial but no you guys are really doing too much in this thread.
r/music,Wtf...no way it's been a year
r/music,"Rest in peace. You have touched us all with your music, and you certainly inspired me. To see you go the way you did means how brave you were to fight your battles like the rest of us. Even though you have lost yours, we can all still keep on fighting for you as well as ourselves.

Avicii (1989-2018)"
r/music,"I remember listening to Levels with my EDM fan friend in high school. Boy, those were the days. Miss him. Heard his album was coming this year, which should be neat, hope he releases some good tracks, maybe he even made a throwback type track... EDM first started in the mid 80‚Äôs actually with the early Detroit techno, even earlier stuff like boogie and electro funk were heavily synth based too, you could even say the first EDM track was I Feel Love by Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder (they didn‚Äôt have drops in this song though). I mainly listen to foreign music nowadays, because even though I like my EDM, my preferred subgenres are funkot, chillot, breakfunk, and Indonesian breakbeat. Maybe Avicii created a track that‚Äôs similar, so I‚Äôd listen to that, he still had major crossover success. If his album is released I feel like we‚Äôll have songs with major crossover success like Wake Me Up and Levels. Even 90‚Äôs EDM artists were just one step behind, as Wake Me Up reached high up in the country charts."
r/music,I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool
r/music,"I wanted the to explain how Avicii changed music, he was a great musician and a artist,  this is my perspective as a musician, listener and fan. Its starts with the state of electronic music before Avicii arrived. So I apologize for the back story.

Avicii was one Artist, who had a lot of talent and I always respected musically.  I make electronic and call it computer music myself; and so naturally, I still listen and I have always listened to electronic and all its classifications and variants. So Electronic dance music was coming out of a drought or hangover from the 1990's- 2000s scene.  But in 2008 electronic dance music started to make a reappearance.  Fyi..electronic music was being kept alive and the scene during this period  2003- 2007 mainly in France, UK (there was almost nothing on the radio being aired or in the clubs and nothing to download really from napster, kazza and then apple music, in the US, no one listened to it anymore)  This doesn't mean that producers and dj's weren't making music like Eric Prydz ""call on me"").  In 2008 there were interesting songs, DJ's doing there own thing, hit or miss stuff.  I started listening to Pete Tong's Radio 1 show. So Pete Tong plays this artist, really catchy raw song, Avicii's earliest stuff, I liked it reminded me of my style. So then some of you may remember Avicii released a song called ""Ryu"" which was his take, to musically challenge other artists and musically recreate Ryu the character from the game Street Fighter with a Keygen(application crack) sound, not only was the song a banger, you could tell he was different. Because there was soul and heart in his electronic music, which a lot of electronic music did not have, until then it was pretty soulless, maybe besides Dead Maus, not really. Also Ryu was very refined.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMUnvEX9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMUnvEX9s)  \- Avicii Ryu 2009

I would say more EDM artists started gravitating to Avicii style in 2009 2010,  he crystallized and help define the EDM sound. To where Swedish House Mafia, Pryda and all the popular DJs, even up to today like ABGT, are influenced in some way by Avicii.

Avicii went further with Levels, I heard the original, before the vocals, and it blew up, and Pete Tong recommended he copy right it, form a label and release it while on air. Avicii said it was an idea, after he added the vocal, ""I got a good feeling"" which made the song so soulful, for that time, he really took electronic to a different level and that's what made him popular bringing him in center of EDM in 2010, 2011. By then dubstep  and the whole scene was taking off, there was a defined sound, cohesive in EDM and that included dubstep, one could say the sound of a generation.

Everyone knows Silhouettes and that song took the genre further, and really alot of EDM even up until today still has constructs of that song, it heavily influenced all EDM and it was deep also, highly soulful, its what he did and defined him as an artist.

Avicii kept releasing songs further defining EDM and changing music in general.

So then I think at Miami Ultra in 2013 or 2014 festival, which has been going on for decades now. He played ""Wake me up"" and he got boo'ed and the sentiment was; what is this song? country music.  The song is one of my favorites, it ended up blowing up, becoming his most popular song and the cross over EDM song, to where Coldplay and other major music artists where coming to him to produce songs on their album. And wake me up again changed and influenced electronic music.

He came down with his illness and took a break, but still came back and further pushed the limits of EDM and refined music in general.

I had the opportunity in 2009 to go to a small venue, no more then 50 people in a downtown club in orlando fl, to see him. I knew who he was as an artist then and I was looking forward to hear him spin, this was before he became popular. I didn't make it down that night, and I will forever regret it.

&amp;#x200B;

In short: Avicii crystallized and help define the EDM sound. kept pushing the genre, became more soulful in his music or it made you think, then he became at one point; Musics top musician, and crossed over the electronic music sound to where it was main stream."
r/music,Oman thats sad
r/music,All of the trolls in here can piss off. This man singlehandedly changed EDM forever. What horrible lives you must live to talk badly about a dead man
r/music,How did he kill himself and why?
r/music,He died? I wasn't a fan but I don't know how I never heard.
r/music,My god the True EDM OGs guys down here. Yes 90s EDM was far better. IN fact electronic music was at its best when it was produced by a caveman with animal bones because nothing good was released after I turned 15.
r/music,"He's dead?

damn"
r/music,I was literally listening to You Make Me when I saw this.
r/music, Avicci died??? Omg i live under a rock
r/music,Yeah really cool
r/music,He freaking died?!? When?
r/music,His music saved my life.
r/music,‚ÄúCool.‚Äù - Jon Oliver
r/music,"I was at Army Basic Training when one of our DS asked if anyone liked EDM, and then he told us this news. Really bummed me out. While cleaning weapons that day he put some on Avicii, it was nice. Guess he was a fan too."
r/music,Has anything been released since his death? Didn‚Äôt know if he had anything in the works that came out after.
r/music,"i still havent actively listened to his songs,. sure ive heard some covers and that one wierd song but thats about it"
r/music,Let the man RIP. They killed him by overworking him and yet they STILL release songs in his name... how ironic is that? Dude can‚Äôt even stop making music in his death because the labels are so greedy.
r/music,Av√≠cii died???
r/music,Avicii is dead? Spotify just told me he had new music
r/music,Meanwhile the music industry doesn‚Äôt even bat an eye
r/music,I greatly prefer the closing theme.
r/music,That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find me.
r/music,"Town to town, up and down the dial. Pretty well describes a career in media."
r/music,Happy Easter everyone..
r/music,Phish does a good cover at their shows sometimes https://youtu.be/_Dpz7UCjxQM

&gt; ZZ Top is an American rock trio formed in 1969 in Houston, Texas. The band has, since 1970, consisted of bassist/vocalist Dusty Hill, vocalist/guitarist Billy Gibbons (the band's leader, main lyricist and musical arranger), and drummer Frank Beard. ""As genuine roots musicians, they have few peers"", according to critic Michael ""Cub"" Koda. ""Gibbons is one of America's finest blues guitarists working in the arena rock idiom [...] while Hill and Beard provide the ultimate rhythm section support.""

&gt; The band released its first album‚Äîcalled ZZ Top's First Album‚Äîin 1971. Beginning with blues-inspired rock, the trio later incorporated new wave, punk rock and dance-rock by using synthesizers. Their songs have a reputation for containing humorous lyrics laced with double entendres and innuendo.

&gt; The band's top-selling album is their 1983 release Eliminator, which sold more than 10 million copies in the United States. Total record sales of 25 million place ZZ Top among the top-100-selling artists in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. That includes 11 gold, seven platinum and three multi-platinum records as of 2016, according to the RIAA. By 2014, ZZ Top had sold more than 50 million albums worldwide.

&gt; ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004.

&gt; The original line-up was formed in Houston and consisted of Gibbons, bassist/organist Lanier Greig (died February 2013) and drummer Dan Mitchell. The name of the band was Gibbons' idea. The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed B.B. King and Z.Z. Hill and thought of combining the two into ""ZZ King"", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that ""king is going at the top"" which brought him to ""ZZ Top"".

&gt; ZZ Top was managed by Bill Ham, a Waxahachie, Texas native, who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, ""Salt Lick"", in 1969, and the B-side contained the song ""Miller's Farm"". Both songs were credited to Gibbons. Immediately after the recording of ""Salt Lick"", Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Mitchell was replaced by Frank Beard of the American Blues. Due to lack of interest from U.S. record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from London Records. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and Dusty Hill was selected as his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Beaumont, Texas, on February 10.

&gt; In addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ZZ Top's First Album (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with ""barrelhouse"" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released Rio Grande Mud (1972), which failed commercially and the promotional tour consisted of mostly empty auditoriums.

&gt; In addition to recording and performing concerts, ZZ Top has also been involved with films and television. In 1990, the group appeared as the ""band at the party"" in the film Back to the Future Part III, and played the ""Three Men in a Tub"" in the movie Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme. ZZ Top made further appearances, including the ""Gumby with a Pokey"" episode of Two and a Half Men in 2010[48] and the ""Hank Gets Dusted"" episode of King of the Hill in 2007. The band was also guest hosts on an episode of WWE Raw. Billy Gibbons also has a recurring role as the father of Angela Montenegro in the television show Bones; though the character is never named, it is strongly implied that Gibbons is playing himself. Their song ""Sharp Dressed Man"" was one of the theme songs used for the television show Duck Dynasty, and on the series finale of the show they appeared with Si Robertson as a vocalist to perform the song on stage during Robertson's retirement party. Black Dahlia Films, led by Jamie Burton Chamberlin, of Seattle and Los Angeles, has contributed documentaries and back line screen work (the footage on back screens during live shows) and has become an integral part of the band's film-making. ZZ Top made a guest appearance on the television show St. Elsewhere on November 14, 1984 Season 3 Episode 8 ""Sweet Dreams"" in Luther's dream. While the band appears in Luther's dream, once Luther wakes he finds the ""Z"" keychain in the lock of the door to the room he was sleeping in. 

&gt; ZZ Top's music videos won awards throughout the 1980s, winning once each in the categories Best Group Video, Best Direction, and Best Art Direction. The videos that won the VMAs are ""Legs"", ""Sharp Dressed Man"" and ""Rough Boy"". Some of the high honors ZZ Top have achieved include induction into Hollywood's RockWalk in 1994, the Texas House of Representatives naming them ""Official Heroes for the State of Texas"", a declaration of ""ZZ Top Day"" in Texas by then-governor Ann Richards on May 4, 1991, and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. They were also given commemorative rings by actor Billy Bob Thornton from the VH1 Rock Honors in 2007.

&gt; ZZ Top also holds several chart and album sales feats, including six number-one singles on the Mainstream Rock chart. From the RIAA, ZZ Top has achieved four gold, three platinum and two multiple-platinum album certifications, in addition to one diamond album. In addition to this, many of their songs have been in regular rotation on classic rock and hard rock radio stations.  Read more on Last.fm.

r/music,Fun story: A couple years ago I was getting ready to move from DC area to the West Coast and posted my Vox AC30 amp for sale on Craigslist. The next day I was contacted by an interested buyer who turned out to be the stage/production manager (I forget his actual title) for Kurt Vile and Courtney Barnett. They had blown an amp on tour and needed one for a show at the 9:30 club that night. I sold them the amp knowing they‚Äôd be able to get more use of it than I ever did. Two nights later they were using it at the Ryman in Nashville. The manager sent me a pic of it on stage during the show.

&gt; Kurt Vile (born 1980 in Philadelphia) is an American guitarist and singer. Previously the lead guitarist in the band The War on Drugs, he began his solo career in 2008.

&gt; Vile began his musical career in 2003 creating lo-fi home recordings with frequent collaborator Adam Granduciel. The duo subsequently formed the indie rock band The War on Drugs in 2005. Vile departed following the release of their debut studio album, Wagonwheel Blues, in 2008.

&gt; Vile's music has been likened to Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, and Tom Petty. His first album for Matador, titled Childish Prodigy was released in October 2009. Prior to signing with Matador, Vile released two albums, God Is Saying This To You and Constant Hitmaker, on Mexican Summer and Woodsist, respectively. He plays both solo shows as well as shows with a backing band called The Violators.

&gt; Smoke Ring For My Halo, released in March of 2011, is Kurt Vile's fourth album and second official release for Matador Records. Uncut placed the album at number 14 on its list of ""Top 50 albums of 2011"" and garnered Vile the iTunes #Rewind2011 Singer/Songwriter Album of the Year. Vile followed up the widely acclaimed album with the six-song EP release, So Outta Reach, in November of the same year. The EP was composed of tracks originating from the same sessions that birthed Smoke Ring for My Halo. So Outta Reach includes the single 'The Creature', acknowledged as one of Vile's best, and a driving rock cover of Bruce Springsteen's 'Downbound Train'.  Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Diamond Head are a British heavy metal band formed in 1976 in Stourbridge, England. They were one of the leading members of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) and are acknowledged by later bands like Metallica and Megadeth as an important early influence.

&gt; Formed by school friends Tatler and Harris, the band recorded and released self-financed demo tapes in 1977 and 1979 and with their unique sound and quality of song writing gained enough attention to tour as support with AC/DC and Iron Maiden. A clutch of record companies fought to sign the band, while their first album, variously known as "" The White Album"" or Lightning to the Nations, was released by the band via mail-order only in 1980 by their own Happy Face Records. Each plain label LP featured the signature of one or other of the band members and has become on of the most sought after collector items from the time. Its success finally led to a record deal with MCA Records in 1981. The first major label LP Borrowed Time was enthusiastically received ( getting to #24 in the UK album charts), although the more experimental follow-up Canterbury, in 1983 suffered pressing problems and criticism over the progressive direction. Stalling creatively, the band split up for the first time in 1985.

&gt; In 1991 Tatler and Harris reformed Diamond Head. The same year Sean Harris (the vocalist) worked on a song with Dave Mustaine for Megadeth called ""Crown Of Worms"" - it was unreleased but would feature on the remastered version of Countdown to Extinction. In 1993, featuring contributions by Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath and Dave Mustaine of Megadeth the band released Death and Progress. In 1994 the band split again and did not reform until 2002. During which time they did a tour with Megadeth, who'd also re-formed after Mustaine had recovered enough to be able to play guitar again. After news of work on a new album, fans were surprised to hear of the departure of Sean Harris in 2004 and his replacement by Nick Tart. Brian Tatler is now the only ever-present member in the Diamond Head line-up. The band's latest album, All Will Be Revealed, was released in 2005, but was very different from their early material.

&gt; Diamond Head are probably most famous among heavy metal fans for their influence on Metallica. Metallica acknowledge them as a very important early influence and have often covered Diamond Head songs at gigs. Harris was even asked to join Metallica in the 1980's but turned the band down. The song Helpless was rumored to be a song Lars Ulrich forced the band to struggle through as an unrehearsed encore in the early days of their formation. Sucking My Love, Am I Evil and The Prince were also common live covers at that time. The earliest known actual recording of these songs exists as a rehearsal demo recorded at then-bassist Ron McGovney's house in March of 1982. The Metal Up Your Ass live demo, recorded in November of that year, featured a live rendition of Am I Evil. The Prince was also played, but the tape ran out too soon to catch it. The song would see another demo release as part of the Horsemen Of The Apocalypse demo in 1983. Sucking My Love exists on various bootlegs that have been circulating since 1982 along with a recording on the early demo 'No Life Til Leather'.

&gt; The first official release of Am I Evil came in 1983 as part of the Creeping Death EP, paired with another NWOBHM classic Blitzkrieg, by the band of the same name. The two songs were also included in the first pressing of the Kill 'Em All LP when it was re-released by Elektra Records.

&gt; Helpless would see a proper release with Garage Days Re-Revisited in 1987, and The Prince was included as a B-side to the Harvester Of Sorrow single.

&gt; The official recordings of Helpless, Am I Evil, and The Prince would also be featured on Metallica's 2-CD Garage Inc. compilation, a collection of numerous other cover songs that the band had played over the years. The first CD in the set was newly recorded covers, one of which was Diamond Head's It's Electric.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/6515d5fb5b4b4db49d05bcdc1e2a12d0.png)  

&gt; Prince formed The Revolution in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1979 as his backing band for his first concert tour. The original lineup consisted of Gayle Chapman on keyboards, Andr√© Cymone on bass, Dez Dickerson on guitar, Doctor Fink on keyboards and Bobby Z. on drums &amp; percussion.

&gt; The band went nameless for almost three years while supporting Prince live and appearing in his music videos. Chapman and Cymone left in the early 1980's and were replaced by Lisa Coleman on keyboards and Brownmark on bass. The first album on which The Revolution performed was the 1982 Prince release, 1999, which has the band's moniker written in reverse on the back cover. 

&gt; When the 1999 Tour ended in 1983, Dez Dickerson left the band for religious reasons and was replaced by Lisa's childhood friend and soon-to-be lover Wendy Melvoin on guitar. The first album officially released as Prince &amp; The Revolution was Purple Rain in 1984, which sold over 16 million copies in the United States alone. 

&gt; The band's sound incorporated heavy metal, pop, funk, R&amp;B and hard rock elements. Wendy Melvoin &amp; Lisa Coleman formed a particular creative bond with Prince and greatly influenced the band's output during the rest of their tenure. The band achieved two number-one Billboard 200 albums (Purple Rain &amp; Around The World In A Day), six top ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and won three Grammy Awards. 

&gt; In 1985, members of the soon-to-be-defunct group The Family (which, in turn, included former members of another group, The Time) joined The Revolution, along with people from Sheila E.'s band. This included the addition of three dancers/vocalists/comic foils (known as The Bodyguards).

&gt; The last lineup of Prince &amp; the Revolution was informally known as the Counter-Revolution and consisted of:

&gt; - Jerome Benton (The Bodyguards)
- Atlanta Bliss (trumpet)
- Greg Brooks (The Bodyguards)
- Lisa Coleman (keyboards, piano and vocals)
- Doctor Fink (keyboards and vocals)
- Eric Leeds (saxophone)
- Brown Mark (bass guitar and vocals)
- Susannah Melvoin (backing vocals)
- Wendy Melvoin (guitar and vocals)
- Prince (lead vocals, guitar, and piano)
- Wally Safford (The Bodyguards)
- Miko Weaver (guitar)
- Bobby Z. (drums)

&gt; The Revolution was officially disbanded by Prince in 1986 after the Hit N Run tour, which supported Parade, the soundtrack for the movie Under the Cherry Moon. Melvoin and Coleman went on to a successful career as Wendy &amp; Lisa. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Ben Howard (born 24 April 1987) is an English singer-songwriter, born in London. He moved to Totnes, Devon, in his teens. Howard's musically-inclined parents exposed him at a young age to their favourite records from singer-songwriter artists such as Bob Dylan, Nina Simone and John Martyn.  Howard began writing his own songs and after a short spell studying journalism, he decided in 2009 at the age of 21 to become a full-time musician. 

&gt; After building up a reputation with his gigs across the UK, Howard was eventually asked to sign to Island Records. His first album, Every Kingdom, was released on October 3, 2011 and debuted at #7 on the UK album chart. It sold in excess of 1 million copies globally, received a Mercury Music Prize nomination, and was the catalyst for Ben picking up two Brit Awards in 2012 for British Breakthrough and British Solo Male Artist.  

&gt; The follow up, 'I Forget Where We Were' was released on 20th October 2014 through Island Records. It was produced by Ben and his drummer Chris Bond at Start Point Farm Studios in Devon.

&gt; Phish is a rock band which formed in 1983 in Burlington, Vermont, United States. For most of their career, the group's lineup has consisted of Trey Anastasio (guitar, vocals), Page McConnell (keyboards, vocals), Mike Gordon (bass, vocals) and Jon Fishman (drums, vocals, vacuum cleaner).

&gt; The band is known for musical improvisation, extended jams, blending of genres, and a dedicated fan base. Their music blends elements of a wide variety of genres, including funk, progressive rock, psychedelic rock, folk, country, jazz, blues, bluegrass, and pop. Phish were part of a movement of improvisational rock groups, inspired by the Grateful Dead and colloquially known as ""jam bands"", which gained considerable popularity as touring concert acts in the 1990s.

&gt; After 15 years of performing together, Phish went on hiatus in 2000. They resumed touring in December 2002, but disbanded in 2004 after a farewell performance at their Coventry Festival in Vermont. They reunited in March 2009 for a series of three consecutive concerts played in the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia, and have since resumed performing regularly.

&gt; Although the group received little radio play or MTV exposure, Phish developed a large following by word of mouth during the 1990s, particularly through fan-record tapes of their concerts, which circulated for free online with the band's permission.  While often compared to the Grateful Dead, Phish finds their roots in styles such as jazz, funk and alternative rock as opposed to the Dead, who were more influenced by folk, country and blues. 

&gt; Each Phish concert is different in terms of the songs included and the order in which they appeared, and (for many songs) in the way in which they were performed. Also unique to Phish are their large summer festivals which draw upwards of 70K people to remote areas in Maine and New York State as well as close to 100K for their epic Millennium Show in the Everglades of South Florida. 

&gt; Along with Bob Dylan and The Beatles, Phish were one of the first bands to have an Internet newsgroup - rec.music.phish - launched in 1991. 

&gt; In regards to Phish, Rolling Stone magazine proclaimed ""Given their sense of community, their ambition and their challenging, generous performances, Phish have become the most important band of the Nineties."" Read more on Last.fm.

r/iama,Are you going to make Westworld?
r/iama,"How much did the town cost, and who is the solitary resident?"
r/iama,"I've been there before and brought Robert (the caretaker) packs of water for his troubles and an awesome tour.   Is he still living on-site?  Will touring the area still be allowed?

Souvenir proof:  https://i.imgur.com/gfXsrbk.jpg

Congrats on your ghost town endevour!

edit:  What about overnights at the hotel?"
r/iama,So the town has had a murder a week and now it‚Äôs just down to Robert. Do you ever wonder there might be more to Robert than you think?
r/iama,"Since you own the town, are you allowed to tear the whole thing down to rebuild or is it protected as a historic site by the state?"
r/iama,Will you guys be reimplementing the weekly murders?
r/iama, How much of the original town is standing? Are you planning to reconstruct historically or build contemporary structures instead?
r/iama,"Are you planning on moving there yourself? How far do you have to travel for basic supplies? (Groceries, etc?)

(Edit: spelling)"
r/iama,Have you considered allowing films to shoot there?
r/iama,"So you plan to let people explore a bit, or maybe create ways that people can come and walk the town?"
r/iama,Do you wear a top hat and tails and a sash with ‚ÄòMAYOR‚Äô on it and set up mannequins on the street and give bombastic speeches from a balcony of the saloon?  Because that‚Äôs what I would do.
r/iama,Can you tell us what buildings and infrastructure you got in the deal? Did you get all the mineral rights for the property?
r/iama,"Did you get the mineral rights, or equivalent of, for the town? And if so, would you turn it in to a mining attraction/retreat/holiday park type thing if it still yields any?"

r/iama,Which of you is the city sheriff and which is the city chief?

r/iama,What was the motivation to buy it?
r/iama,If I run for mayor in your city will you vote for me? Why and why not?
r/iama,Why?
r/iama,"Is there any potential/ do you have the intention of extracting more minerals from the land? I imagine mining technology has improved, but then I guess if you were the one to buy it, It probably wasn't economical for a mining company to do so. 

Also I'd probably wait a while before reinstating the weekly murders. You want at least a season, not a single episode."
r/iama,Do you need any volunteers who will help restore the place in exchange for accommodation &amp; board?
r/iama,Since you own the town will you make drugs and prostitution  legal? I'm trying to figure where I should go on vacation.
r/iama,Is there any way to come help/volunteer? I'm taking a solo roadtrip through that area next month for my 28th birthday and would love to lend a hand on any ongoing projects.

r/iama,Any cool ghosts stories from the town?

r/iama,Can you just make sure that Robert is always taken care of? He‚Äôs my new favorite non fiction internet character.
r/iama,*had. Sorry?
r/iama,"Any potential plans to turn the area around the town into a camping area of sorts? I live up in Vancouver and I know I'd absolutely love to get out with friends and go camping in an area like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how far it is from everything and if the local wildlife is particularly dangerous (snakes?), but the scenery shown in the video sure looks amazing."
r/iama,"Hey, I visited Cerro Gordo last summer!  It was a great experience.  My only question is what are you going to do about the road that leads up to the town?  Even in an all terrain vehicle it was super sketchy to say the least."
r/iama,Population of 1 because you murdered your friend?
r/iama,Can I visit?
r/iama,Any plans on getting a historian's help or such to identify places of interest?

I went in the gross bathroom and began my business. Then some guy kicked open the door, took a picture of me, and said it was going on the internet! Then he said to give him my email and he will give me the link. I thought if I knew where it was I could tell the police the address so I gave him my email address. I didn't want to risk my wife or family or coworkers to see it! He sent me an email that said he changed his mind and wasn't going to post it as long as I gave him a bunch of people I knew's email addresses. He said so he could sell them Herbalife products. I figured it would be better that they got a spam email rather then see me on the toilet so I gave him a list.

I relate to some of what you describe but definitely not as extreme in some aspects, maybe if there's a spectrum is be on it or maybe I'm a hypochondriac :).

When you say you have facts but not recollections, I understand that, because I don't really have any visual memory. But I do remember factually some specific times I spent with people. Like I went to my friend's wedding and we rented an air bnb and I remember details about the place and what we did. I don't have like an emotional or visual memory, I just know that I did those things. It makes these ""fact memories"" really hard to hold on to long-term because unless I am constantly remembering it my ability to recall facts like that is probably only a few months or something.

Do you have anything like that? How do you approach big human questions like ""has my life been worthwhile,"" or ""am I happy?"""
r/iama,"Philosophers ask why we have the same personality traits, the same values, the same goals, from day to day, despite the fact that our conscious minds basically turn off for 8 hours every night.

&amp;#x200B;

One theory we were taught holds that you're a blank slate upon waking up, but your mind immediately encounters memories from your past and they sort of re-mold you back into something consistent with those memories. I've always called this the ""mental furniture"" theory. If I woke up tomorrow and my house was suddenly filled with weightlifting equipment, I would probably pump some iron. If my place were filled with hundreds of magazines, I'd probably read some of them. If my place were severely spartan, with only some incense, a candle, and a reed mat, I would probably engage in some meditation.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I can tell, it seems like your situation is a pretty strong indictment of that theory. You wake up in an ""empty"" house every day, but despite that, you seem to have a stable sense of self. Has that been your experience? Do you think you've ever undergone a pronounced change in your identity in a very short period? Do you have a sense that you're the same person from day to day? Or, conversely, that you're essentially reinventing yourself every day?"
r/iama,"How do you decorate your home?

&amp;#x200B;

Folks I've compared notes with have talked about choosing art, decorative items, plants, lighting, paint, and furniture based on the atmosphere those things create and the feelings that flow from it. And, importantly, we've all found it hard to articulate the details even though we internally seem to have a lot of clarity about our experiences and goals. So, it seems to me that factual memory wouldn't be much help since it's all so hard to pin down or systematize."
r/iama,What do you do for a living?
r/iama,Does this condition affect you perception of time at all? Are you able to tell how much time has passed between events?
r/iama,"In an answer you said, that you enjoyed a concert and you'd like to go again, even though you can't remember, but you remember enjoying it. Is there no difference between you and 'regular' people when you are experience emotion in the present? And does this mean, every time you hear the same song, it's like you experience it for the first time?

And how do you 'forget' emotions? Is it like in an 'instant', does it slowly fade away? I can't imagine a person rocking to a song at a live concert and when the song is finished goes like ""Well, I remember having a good time.""

&amp;#x200B;

Beside not being able to recall memory, does your 'brain function properly'? For instance, can you get addicted as well or does your ""brain-chemistry"" work differently? You know, smoking a cigarette gives you a good feeling, releases dopamine (I think), and your brain tells you ""well, smoke another one, can't be bad if it felt good, right?"".

&amp;#x200B;

Would you say you're happy? How do you define happiness and what do you do to achieve it? I'm asking because for every person it's different, but you often hear things like accomplishment or recognition, which are based on emotion."
r/iama,"I'm curious, how does this affect your imagination? From what you've said it seems unlikely you'd be able to picture in your mind objects or events from the past as you don't remember what they look like. But are you able to look at something immediately in front of you such as a tea cup, then close your eyes and picture a whole bunch of tea cups; or perhaps what it would look like if the tea cup was a different colour.

Also what about dreams? Do you wake up and recall having any experiences while you were asleep. Obviously you woldn't remember any visual or emotional imagery, I'm just wondering if you can recall on an informational level having had dreams at all."
r/iama,"So basically every time you do something pleasurable, such as eating ice cream, is just like the first time you ever tried it?"
r/iama,"Do you get to hide your own Easter Eggs?

&amp;#x200B;

In all seriousness, though, thanks for doing this. I think I may have something similar. I have little to no memory of my childhood or really anything more than 6 months prior at any given time. It bothers my husband a lot sometimes, because he will bring up something we did together, and I have no memory of it. But then again, he has pretty good autobiographical memory.  Also, anytime I go back and read something I wrote a while back, I get a sort of 'Jamais vu' experience, like I am reading someone else's writing."

r/iama,What type of engineering degree did you get?

I live in the states. Are the requirements the same?"

r/iama,"My office looks out onto a very busy port so I see tons of container and tanker ships coming and going. Sometimes they sit in anchorage for a few days out in the bay. I always wondered, do you guys get to leave the ship during that time? Or do you just have to sit out there in the middle of the bay until it's your turn to dock?"
r/iama,"Maritime labor laws dictate that a seafarer is entitled to 70 hours of rest in a week excluding emergencies/distress situations. Was that strictly implemented on most/all of the vessels you've been on?

Also have you ever been in a PAN PAN or MAYDAY situation?  If yes please share"

r/iama,"Customs officer here, last chance, where are the drugs?"
r/iama,What are the main sorts of tasks that make up the bulk of your ordinary workday?
r/iama,"Let's ignore the political aspects of nuclear powered tankers for a second. 

Navies can demand a higher quality of personnel calling for kids to serve ""God and Country"", and also run them through nearly 2 years of schooling before letting them get even close to their first reactor.  

Corporations aren't going to do that, there's no profit in that kind of training.  We'd be lucky if they just poach ex-navy enlisted, but they'd have to offer 6 figures to beat out the current power plants on their offer. 

Do you feel civilian boat crews at their current pay scale vs land-based equivalents, can be trusted to not fuck up a nuclear reactor powerplant?"

r/iama,Hey Joel! Thanks so much for taking the time to answer questions today. It seems now days zoos get a pretty bad rap from the public. How important are they to conservation and what do you think their place is in modern day society? Are there things you wish more zoos were doing?
r/iama,"Joel - I helped you get photos of the Kirtland's Warbler on mother's day in Michigan. I had such a great day with you and the birds. I get so much positive feedback about the pictures you took when I use them in talks. Thanks for doing what you do ! 

What was your most challenging shoot and why ?"
r/iama,"Hi Joel. Thanks for doing this AMA. Your work is amazing. 

Is there a ""white whale"" you've been chasing? Or a certain species that has been particularly elusive?"
r/iama,Thanks for doing this AMA! I've been following your Instagram for a few years now. So great the work you're doing! How did you get into working with Nat Geo? It must been very competitive to do wildlife photography. What kind of steps would you recommend others to take? Thanks again!
r/iama,"    Everyone, I've got to go now, but I greatly appreciate your questions, and for caring about saving our planet. Please tell everyone you know that you care about the environment, and explain why they should too. Just thinking selfishly, we must have pollinating insects to bring us fruits and vegetables, and intact rainforests to help regulate rainfall in the areas where we grow crops. We need to cut back on our carbon outputs, from eating less meat/no meat to reducing fossil fuel use to keep our climate stable. We truly must have a healthy, intact planet not just for other animals to survive, but to keep humanity going as well.
    Stay hopeful, never give up, and thank you.

r/iama,Hello Joel! I‚Äôm a huge fan of your work and I love seeing your posts on Instagram. It‚Äôs great to learn new things about wildlife and be aware of what we can do to help sustain their environments. At what age did you start getting into photography and do you have any particularly memorable early experiences?
r/iama,"Good Morning Joel,

Thank you for doing this for all of us! 

In your experiences what species of animal has made the most impact on your life? Mainly what animal struck you the most. Made you take a minute and say ""holy cow, this thing is absolutely awesome!"" Thanks you sir!"
r/iama,Loved your Photo Ark TV series--will you be doing another soon?
r/iama,"Hi Joel! I follow your Instagram and am a big fan of your work and your efforts to help animals. I have a few questions.

What's the most impactful thing one person can do to help stop large scale human interference with animal habitats?"
r/iama,"What‚Äôs your take on the last turtle specie that just got extinct?

Do you believe love for animals and especially the environment should be a huge part of the curriculum in a school as well as financial literacy?"
r/iama,"Thanks so much for doing this Joel!

I've watched anything that's available on this journey of yours and I sincerely appreciate everything you are doing, especially being such a great advocate for AZA-accredited institutions. You've been a big inspiration in my own photography as well. What's fascinated me most is your workflow. What's the most difficult shooting situation you've run into in terms of isolating the subject and lighting them?"
r/iama,Are there any species you are particularly concerned about but haven‚Äôt documented yet?
r/iama,"Looking back at the beginning of your photography career, what's something you feel like you should have done more of? Or what's the one thing you wish you had done differently?"
r/iama,"Have you ever met David Attenborough? Huge fan of yours, thanks for all you do!"
r/iama,"Your work is amazing! As a physician don't have much time for hobbies, but I really enjoy taking pictures of animals with my cellphone.  What camera for an amateur like me do you recommend?"
r/iama,"Hi Joel, love your work! What is your favorite body and lens to shoot with? And also what would your lens recommendations be for an amateur wildlife photographer? Thanks and good luck on the rest of the Photo Ark!"
r/iama,"Joel,



Have you read about [Fiona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKGd5vItcBs) the hippo at the Cincinnati zoo?  What are your thoughts on certain zoo animals becoming social media stars?  Who do you think is the most famous animal at any zoo?"
r/iama,"Hi Joel! Appreciate all of your hard work that you‚Äôre doing to bring recognition to these issues. Admittedly, my question is a little off-base, but I was wondering if you had any tips for people who may be interested in nature photography, I.e. certain things to focus on when getting started?"
r/iama,"Your work is amazing!

What's the longest you've had to wait or the farthest you've had to trek to get the shot you wanted?"
r/iama,NG photographers are known for going above and beyond to capture the beauty of nature (ie: the pictures of photographers ascending a volcano w/ shoes on fire - could be fake for all I know)... What is your line that you won't cross in the line of duty for the sake of photography?
r/iama,"Hey Joel, I've followed you Instagram for a long time and was excited to see that you would be doing an AMA. My question is, what is your best piece of advice for a new/aspiring wildlife photographer?"

My questions - What's been the hardest animal to photograph? And what was one of your favourite animals to photograph?"
r/iama,Hey Joel camera nerd here! Was wondering what your favorite camera setup was?!
r/iama,"I visited Photo Ark in Porto, Portugal. Truly amazing photos. What was the hardest animal to take photos?"
r/iama,"how do you manage  ( emotionally) a shoot where the prey is long to die? often us , on the other end of the lens could not know the time it may take for the full range of a photo shoot that includes a predator taking its prey . i read recently of an interview with a photographer following a water buffalo that had been attacked by monitors , and it took the animal many days to die . it must take a lot of compartmentalism. bless you for the things you may see in nature . and thank you for your work üêçü¶ãüêí"
r/iama,Why do you like taking photographs?
r/iama,"Complete it?  
Why not make it a all species thing?"
r/iama,"Hey Joel, everyone sees the pictures that have the 'perfect' timing, and the misses are always thrown out. Do you have a memory of a time where you missed the perfect moment for a picture that would have been amazing?"
r/iama,"Hey man, glad to see an AMA about something I'm super interested in.  How did you find the gig working for National Geo?"
r/iama,"Just the other day I was looking for a Photo Ark sub Reddit.

Could someone start that, or post photo ark photos to r/natureisfuckinglit ?"
r/iama,"Joe. I was in Yosemite with my family in 1979 I think, may have been 76 or 78 . With them at Bridelveil Falls when the guy who did a one man special issue  of National Geographic on the National Parks took a picture of my daughter with the mist and breeze at her face while I was holding her. Her face was over my shoulder and she must have had that beautific look she would sometimes get when she was in ecstasy. The photographer said to me that if I wanted a copy of it I could get one and gave me his card. He seemed to think it was a good shot. Life went on and I forgot about it and didn't do it. Now my daughter is 44 years old and has two sons. I would like to see if it is possible that this photo still exists in the archives at NG and if I could possibly get a print of it?

The photographer said NG doesn't usually feature pictures of people but he snapped this one because her face moved something in him.

Not certain but it may have been an issue entitled ""Our National Parks"" Published in July 1979.

Volume 156 Number 1."

How/when did your meme game get so spicy?

More seriously, how did you expect the reaction from Reddit to be when you started posting on the Washington Post account?  Were you surprised that it has been generally well-received?

Any plans for future Playing with Politicians streams?  AOC has already made her Twitch debut and would make for an excellent segment.

I've really appreciated seeing what you and other WaPo staffers are able to do on Reddit.

r/iama,Do you think it is important for news orgs to build a presence on new-and-growing social platforms? You've gotten the Washington Post on Reddit and Twitch but only after they've become solidly popular.
r/iama,"Given how badly the news media has bungled even basic reporting on critical issues our entire lives (the ""benefits"" of union busting and free trade in the 90s, need to deregulate Wall Street, Iraq WMDs, pushing austerity after the crash via Reinhart-Rogoff and ""skills gap"", the coordinate smear campaign against Sen Sanders in 2016 (16 negative pieces in as many hours from your paper alone), the whole ""Russia rigged the 2016 election!"" bit, etc etc etc) why should our generation bother reading the output your industry pushes instead of celebrating as your industry crashes and burns around you, bringing you to our level?"
r/iama,"How complicit is games media in terms of the toxicity of their audience?

I often wish that the more mainstream folks that cover gaming (the IGNs and the GameSpots) were more front facing about the current political landscape. When Insomniac allegedly removed puddles from Spider-Man, there was an outpouring of defense for the developers and and a denouncement of this kind of toxicity across the board, but that kind of behavior is so easy to condemn.

There was little to no discussion about PewDiePie's influence over the NZ shooter. The Game Awards invited Boogie2988 to their show not long after he said that some good things came out of the Holocaust. Capcom hired a White guy who pretends to be black and says the n word to voice Morrison in Devil May Cry V, his youtube channel full of transphobia, racism, and antisemitism. I could go on, but these examples are everywhere. Games media does a lot of propping up themselves, and (rightfully) defending devs, but when it comes anywhere close to Social Justice, people are much more hesitant. 

It's just rough, as a Jew, seeing so much antisemitism in the world today and people in the gaming space get away with it without consequence or even be rewarded."

She has a degree in child development, currently either in children's education, and has 1 year of teaching in China under her belt. I have a physiology degree. What kind of job opportunities/pay rates do you think would be realistic for her? For me? Do you have any recommendations for places to look for paid positions? She has an opportunity from a previous volunteer position, though I'm not sure if it is competitive.

I'm a bit wary of going, as teaching isn't a passion of mine. I'm trying to learn as much as I can about what is realistic to expect so I can make the best decision. Any help would be appreciated."

I have been an English teacher for a number of years, both in the States where I‚Äôm originally from and abroad. Because of the nature of the industry, there‚Äôs often an association with ESL/EFL teachers being basically tourists that speak native English and therefore not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù teacher. I know on my part at least that a lot of it is projection, but the stigma definitely exists to some extent (especially in big ESL business countries like Korea). Do you have experience with this as well? If so, have you been able to get to a point of being proud of what you do?

r/iama,"First, thank you for the profile. I am happy to see this rise to the top of the internet. I am here in California (Oakland) and I run a trucking company that operates dump trucks (we work construction jobs) (proof: [www.rockeryapp.com](http://www.rockeryapp.com)). I'm also a graduate of a prestigious private liberal arts college, in case that adds an interesting twist to most people's perception of the trucking industry. I know almost every truck on the road out here and a large proportion of the drivers and owner-operators are Sikh. I have also travelled to Punjab and spent time there learning the culture. In my experience, Sikh's are a very nice and ethically grounded population (look up their practice of Langar for example). They also dominate trucking - I would say they operate 1/3 of the truck on the road. The other 2/3's are Mexican's and aging white guys (generalizations of course). Trucking is ran by brokers who hold relationships with owner-operators, then pimp out the trucks to customer while taking a fee (10 percent is typical). Many of these brokers conglomerate and share contacts so they can also cover the truck requests of their customers. I use many brokers to find trucks, I can call three brokers and sometimes the same owner-operators show up. This is a really fascinating story and industry that should be told. Everything we touch has been touched by a truck at some point in its lifespan. Best of luck out there and may we let tolerance rule the roads."

Damian Wayne is such lovely creation. Did you anticipate audiences would truly end up loving the little shit?

Happy! is miraculous. Is this the kind of demented Morrisonia that you would have envisioned taking root in television, ahead of some of your other, less brutal stuff? For instance, it seems ‚ÄúJoe the Barbarian‚Äù could have been an easier choice, but Happy! is a home run."
r/iama,"Hey Patton! 

Thanks to you both for doing this. 

My question is in regards to the book ""I'll be gone in the dark"", I understand if this is too sensitive of a subject and you would rather abstain. 

First, your wife did some amazing work and I'm glad that she played a role in helping keeping the search alive. 

I was really touched by the epilogue you wrote, do you ever see yourself actually going to the Golden State Killer for the conversation ~~you~~ she wrote about? If you do, will it be something you update the book to or would you consider it a private matter at that point?

I loved your take on the X-Men! You brought the X-Men into the 21st century with some bold story choices. Was there ever any pushback from Marvel at the time over the direction you wanted to take the title? Also, would you ever be interested in writing for that title or a specific X-Men character again in the future?"
r/iama,"Hey guys. I loved Happy! Season 1, and I can't wait to find the time and start watching Season 2. It is my favorite comic-to-TV adaptations to come out. I have one question for each of you.

Grant,
Your current Green Lantern run is the best comic title right now. It is such a great story that is dense with a bunch of lesser known characters from the past that are not utilized as much anymore. How do you go about starting a story that has so much reference material in it and then incorporating it into a modern title like this one?

Patton,
One of my favorite internet series is the CollegeHumor Batman clips with Pete Holmes. In my opinion, you playing the Penguin really fit, and that skit was one of my favorites of the bunch. Could you ever see yourself reprising that role in a more serious movie/show that is live action or animated? Or playing any comic villain for that matter?

Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA guys!"
r/iama,"Hi Grant!

* What's your favorite thing about Patton?
* Out of all the comics you've written, are there any that stand out above the rest?
* Are there any story ideas you've wanted to write, but never had a chance yet?

Hi Patton!

* What's your favorite thing about Grant?
* Every time I catch you show up in a movie or TV, I'm always excited because you're so funny.  Not really a question, I guess, but how do you do it?
* I still watch King of Queens reruns all the time, do you have any funny stories from behind the scenes?"
r/iama,"I have been loving Happy! and Doom Patrol!  Really amazing to see content like this on TV (never thought I'd see the day!)  Thanks to everyone involved with these shows for the bold and stunning work!  


Mr Morrison, to me your writing deals with enormous themes like individuality vs conformity, etc, with lots of contrast between the character's viewpoints and actions.  **Do you find it is better to lay out the groundwork and plan these themes in advance or do they just spring up while you are working?**"
r/iama,"Hey grant! I'm a huge fan and inspiring comic book writer. Can I get your blessing? 

Patton, I also perform stand up. Can I get yours as well?"
r/iama,"Hey Grant,

In high school, your New X-Men run blew my mind in regards to what could be done with the comic book medium (It was my first taste of your writing, I hadn‚Äôt read Animal Man or Doom Patrol at that point).  If you had twelve more issues to write on that book, what would have happened in them?"
r/iama,"Grant, thank you so much for everything man. I can‚Äôt really put into words how appreciative I am to have had The Invisibles, Kid Eternity, Animal Man, or really any of your work keep me company during my darkest times. I have two main questions if that‚Äôs cool: 

1. Vimanarama is one of my favourite comics of yours. It has so much heart. How did the idea for that story come about? 

2. I love Doctor Strange, especially the psychedelic Ditko-era stuff. Have you ever felt interested in writing him and giving that world your own unique spin? How do you feel about the character in general? 

Thanks :)"
r/iama,"Hi Grant, I noticed that you titled an issue of The Invisibles ""Venus as a Boy"" and that there are many other musical references in your work. Are you a Bj√∂rk fan ( I'm going to see her perform in NYC next month) and what music has been inspiring to you lately?
I'm absolutely in love with your work by the way. Thank you ‚úåÔ∏è"
r/iama,"Grant, What happened to the Aliens Vs Dinosaurs project? It was such an amazingly ridiculous concept, how did it come about?"
r/iama,"Hey Grant, thanks for doing this AMA! And Patton you are amazing.  


**Question for Mr. Morrison:**

* Do you still perform ritual or chaos magick?
* Do you consider yourself an occultist these days, and do you have any advice for anyone interested in getting into ritual magick?"
r/iama,Hey Patton! Were you familiar with the character of Space Cabbie before being cast in *Justice League Action*? Who are your favorite comic characters?
r/iama,"Hey Grant just wanted to ask 2 things.

1. Since you finally got your hands on Hal Jordan i was wondering how different your JLA run would be if the emerald twilight storyline never happened and if Hal your was your GL and not Kyle during JLA

2. im just wondering but theres a certain i know WHO LOATHES SUPERMAN to death. so much so when he read your All-Star Superman. he and i kid you not unironically was 100% for lex luthor and thinks he was right about everything. thoughts on that ?


thanks for everything and i just bought your ominbus New X-men run. cant wait to try it out !

patton i got no questions for you but i loved you in ratatouille...... thats all"
r/iama,"Hello Grant,

First off let me say thank you for featuring the Lakota Sioux with Man of Bats storyline. They get very little representation in media.

**Are you ever going to reprint your plays, Red King Rising and Depravity?** I think your perspective would be a welcome addition to the theatrical world. I introduce Clive Barker's theatrical work (he just reprinted a few of his plays) to everyone I can.

Many thanks!"
r/iama,"Hello Grant! Thanks for doing this, I‚Äôm a huge fan of your work. 

With you working with Ezra Miller on the Flash, I have to ask, do you ever see yourself coming back to the book? I love Emergency Stop and the Human Race, and I would love to see more from you, solo, on the Flash. 

Thanks for coming by!"
r/iama,What is the very best cheese?
r/iama,"Big fans of both you fellers.  Thank you for all you've done.  I'll get right to questions and not bother you with any more praise now.

This one's to both of you: If you could write a story for or act as any established character in any medium that character is not normally known for, what character and medium would you choose?"
r/iama,"Hey Grant,

Funnily enough, Final Crisis was my introduction both to you and to comic books in general, and Multiversity cemented my opinion that both you and the industry are indescribable parts of my life.

With that in mind, how are things moving in regards to Multiversity Too, and might it feature our favorite ape heroes from the 53rd Earth?"
r/iama,"First, I'd like to say that Happy! is amazing and one of the best shows on TV right now. I also have a question for Grant: It was announced last year that you are working on a TV show of The Invisibles. Can you give us any news about the project so far? And will the show take place in the 90' like in the comics, since the story ended in 2012?"
r/iama,"Hey King Mob!

I heard you're no longer a vegetarian - what made you change your mind?"
r/iama,Hey Patton! I grew up watching King of Queens so I‚Äôve always been a big fan. My question is do you stay in touch with Kevin James? Would you ever do a reboot or ‚Äúyear later‚Äù kind of episodes  of that show?
r/iama,Hello Grant Morrison! Would you ever consider writing Dick Grayson again?
r/iama,"Hey Grant! Huge, huge fan of your work, it's inspired me and changed me so much that I could not even say how much. Thank you, just thank you. Your work means so much to so many of us and you're my creative hero.

**1)** You're doing **The Green Lantern**! Could you talk about what it is like to work on the DC Cosmos? And as a big fan of cosmic stuff, especially Kirby, Starlin and Marvel stuff, what do you feel makes **DC Cosmic** a distinct, rich and interesting setting to write in and develop, as opposed to any others out like Marvel, Star Wars or even Star Trek?"
r/iama,"Grant, 

Have you and Chris Claremont ever crossed paths? I always thought it was funny how he said that while he hated what you did to the characters the writing was so damn good he couldn't stop reading."
r/iama,"Hey Patton! As a bit MSTie and a fan of your performance on MST3K, I was wondering what your favourite episode to shoot was.

Hey Grant! I'm a huge fan of your work too. I'm usually able to understand most of what's going on in your work, but on Nameless I was completely lost. Was there any particular reason you made Nameless so out-there?"
r/iama,"Hello Grant! huge fan of your work, I have two questions for you.

* Do you think you've written all you can about Superman?
* Do you have plans to break into different mediums, like video games?"
r/iama,"Hi Grant, I have only one question for you.
How are things going with the Flash movie?"
r/iama,"Patton: Deputy Bob is the best character to ever appear on television. Not a question, just an observation.

Grant: Now that Happy! is wildly successful, any chance of finally getting that Invisibles adaptation we all secretly crave?"
r/iama,"Hey Grant!

Seeing the Doom Patrol on DC Universe has been incredibly satisfying for me and countless other fans, especially when they give a tip of the hat to your run.
So my question for you is:

**As a creator, what is your opinion on others adapting your work? Are you someone who can enjoy other interpretations or do you try to avoid them as best you can?**"
r/iama,"Hello Grant,

My favourite moment capturing you on camera was when you told that kid that it was ok to make mistakes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4epj4J9OYk

Thank you for doing that, it really encourages me in my own artistic pursuits.

Any other advice for aspiring writers, artists, musicians?"
r/iama,"Hey Grant, youve gotten me through a lot of hard times. Flex Mentallo and JLA WWIII make me cry every time. I was wondering, have you ever wanted to go back and rewrite one of your comics and do something different? If so, any particular?"
r/iama,"Hey Grant! Thanks for doing an AMA, been a huge fan of yours since I was 13. I have a few questions for you:

What were your future plans for Dick Grayson as Batman if he had stuck around longer?

Do you have any interest in writing The Flash again? Whether it be Barry, Wally, Bart... even Jay??

Would you be interested in writing the Doom Patrol again after the success of the live action series? Or do you think you‚Äôve told everything you wanted to tell? Also, what‚Äôs it been like to see ideas and characters that you came up with being portrayed in live action?

Will any of the other Green Lanterns be in your GL run? Or even any of the other Lantern corps? Or are you sticking strictly with a Hal centered space cop story?"
r/iama,"Patton, any plans to write another book?"
r/iama,"Could Patton please filibuster for at least 9 minutes over what he thinks ""The Rise of Skywalker"" will entail?"
r/iama,"Mr Morrison, what is the relationship between the Cosmic Dragon Barbatos of DC Metal and the Hyper Adapter Barbatos of Final Crisis?"
r/iama,"Patton, I find you to be creepy. Why is that?"
r/iama,"Grant, everyone is obviously telling you how much we have enjoyed your work
and I'm no different! 

However, you get accused of making Batman too powerful.

What made you want to write Batman as the unbeatable character? 

Also, how the hell did you find The Batman of Zur-en-arhh in the obscure pages of the past?

Thank you sir!"
r/iama,"Hi Grant big fan of your work on Doom Patrol
What do you think of the show so far?"
r/iama,"Hey guys, big fan of both of you, thanks for doing this. 
Mr. Morrison, what is your favorite comic series you ever worked on and why? Also, can you tell us anything about the flash script you‚Äôre working on with Ezra Miller? 



Mr. Oswalt, what is your favorite guest role you‚Äôve had in a TV series, live action or animated? And will you ever reprise your role in Brooklyn Nine-Nine?



Thanks again!"
r/iama,"Grant, Comic publishers aren't always great toward their creative talent, so it's inevitable that fans will want to know: does the Doom Patrol TV series (based largely on your story arc with artist Richard Case) have your blessing (including the use of signature characters like Crazy Jane, Willoughby Kipling and potentially Flex Mentallo and Dorothy Spinner), and do you get anything from it? Do you have any input?"
r/iama,What do you both love most about working with Chris Meloni?
r/iama,Hey. Question for both of you. What made you realize people would actually pay attention to the things you had to say?
r/iama,"Questions for you both : What are your favorite superhero movies you saw so far in this decade?

Did Christopher Meloni ever told how he was filmed in Man of Steel?

&amp;#x200B;

Question for Grant : will you ever returning to Superman again? How about something like new52 Superman in t-shirt but with Frank Quitely as an artist? I really liked Superman in Sideways Annual."
r/iama,"Hey grant, Hows your experience been being editor in chief at **heavy metal magazine** so far?

How is balancing writing green lantern (and heavy metal stories), working on the Happy tv show and being an editor in chief? 

Thanks for doing this ama, looking forward to both your future works and season 2."
r/iama,Also what about Flash movie script? I hope you and Ezra will have success with it.
r/iama,"Mr. Patton, just wanted to let you know you help me sleep a little better every night as Spence. Literally watch it every single night, something comforting about KoQ.

I stumbled a crossed Happy! on Netflix and instantly fell in love with it. Hilarious to the point my side hurts. I‚Äôve rewatched season one 3 times, brilliant and absolutely refreshing to see. Thanks for the fun nights Grant und Patton.

As someone without cable and a slim wallet, what options would I have catching up on season 2?

Edit : Realize I‚Äôm late to this party üéâ  wish you guys the best."
r/iama,"Hey Grant! Well firstly I just want to say thank you so much. Your work has been an incredible inspiration to me, for both my own writing and studying chaos magic. 
My question is about your run on Batman and use of Bat-Mite. The quote ""Imagination is the 5th dimension"" stuck out for me as incorporating those ideas of chaos magic of belief into reality, 
and blurring the line between comic book fantasy and real life. His inclusion seemed especially apt since he's a character that's another layer deep, inside the imagination of an imaginary character. 

So my question is-
**What inspired bringing in Bat-Mite? 
Are there other Silver or Golden Age characters you'd like to bring back?**

[I actually loved the quote so much I got it tattooed, here's a photo](https://imgur.com/afWWtF1)

P.S. Loving Happy! season 2 and am excited for the Easter revamp!"
r/iama,"Grant, whats your favourite current comic series?"
r/iama,"Hi Grant!

I love so many of the characters you have given us over the years. Danny the Street being one of my favorites of all time.

Did you ever think we would see a live action version of Danny the Street and what were your thoughts on how they were portrayed?"
r/iama,"Hey Grant,

I'm really enjoying Happy! and The Green Lantern (Belzebeth is one of the best baddie names ever!).  I wanted to ask you about your book Lovely Biscuits. 

Is there any chance for a reprint or even just an ebook version of it? I would love to read it, but the prices for a used copy are insanely expesnsive.  Thanks."
r/iama,Hey Grant! How has the Flash script going? I really am interested in your take and would love to see it one day on the big screen! Love your work!
r/iama,"Hello, Grant! 10 years ago, Arkham Asylum was my very first comic. The Multiversity is my favorite book of all time. You're my absolute favorite writer. Thank you for introducing me to DC Comics and my dream of writing comics. I have a few questions for you.

1. How many iterations of an idea do you go through before you put pen to paper?

2. It's obvious that sigil magic has inspired many of your books (loved The Invisibles and Nameless). Are there less obvious ways that practicing sigil magic has made you a better writer?

3. Is your Arkham Asylum sequel still in the works? Will it be part of DC Black Label?

4. How is writing for the screen different than writing for comics?

5. Are you currently accepting applications for a prot√©g√©/sidekick?

Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA. I'm looking forward to Happy! Season 2 and The Green Lantern #7. Until next time!"
r/iama,"Mr Oswalt, you recently played Dr Dementor in live action. What is it like playing a character you previously voice acted in a new way like that?"
r/iama,"Hey Grant 
Thank you for doing this, i cant begin to tell you how much your work means to me, your JLA and batman were so influential in helping me get through a really rough patch in my life, i cant thank you enough for your awesome work. Congrats in the success of happy love how weird and crazy it is.
My question/s 
- now that happy is such a success are their any other of your works that you would want to adapt to tv (maybe the invisibles)?
- are their any characters or teams that you have always wanted to write but havent yet gotten the chance?
Anyway thanks for reading and keep up the weird, thoughtful, impactful, and just purely brilliant work."
r/iama,There are many comic adaptations out right now. Have you expressed inrerest in writing an episode for say The Flash or Doom Patrol? Or a DC or Marvel film?
r/iama,"Mr. Morrison, what is your best advice for someone who would want to become a professional comic author?"
r/iama,"Grant first of all thank you for all of the wonder and joy you have brought me throughout my life. Your work means a lot to me and countless others. I have a few questions please stick with me! 

What has been your favorite run to write? And what should we expect going forward with Happy? 

I was surprised to see it was getting a second season because the story had seemingly concluded. Will you be writing any more Happy comics?  


Wishing you well!"
r/iama,"**Question for Grant Morrison** : do you know some sort of meditation, without any fancy magical tools, drugs or anything, that can get person an answers and so much required guidence he/she **desperately** looking for?

Is that true that you evoked comic book characters, and if so how did you do it exactly?"
r/iama,Hi Grant! I‚Äôm a massive fan of your work! I loved the multiversity and I recall in a interview you had plans for the multiversity too graphic novels stating with one focusing on The Flash. Will you at some point get around to doing them or are they scrapped? I was also wondering what kinds of other characters we could see from this series. I‚Äôm loving your work on GL right now and I wish you the best.
r/iama,"Hey guys! I have two questions, if that's alright.

1. Is Happy season 2 going to be coming to Netflix? I don't have cable so I'm a bit behind, but I streamed the first season and really liked it, so I'm crossing my fingers that this most recent season will make its way onto Netflix too.

2. This one's more of a personal one for Patton, but I've been binging your comedy specials as of late and I've kinda fallen in love with you in the process? I know I'm probably sitting at a lonely table for one here, but I just can't help it, I find you totally adorable. But that's enough gushing from me. Anyways, I was wondering if you've ever had/currently have any big-time celebrity crushes? (That is, aside from your lovely wife, of course.)

Thanks in advance!"
r/iama,"Hey Grant!

First off I just want to thank you for writing all these amazing comics, from All Star Superman to Animal Man to Klaus to Doom Patrol, your works have really managed to show me the wonders of comics and the medium, so thank you :)

Could you reveal any details of your **Teen Titans** pitch for DC Comics in the 90s? 

Thanks so much and have a nice day!"
r/iama,Mr. Morrison I've been a fan of you long before Happy! ever since I've read your Doom Patrol run. Mr. Nobody and the Brotherhood of Dada are my favorite villains ever. What I want to ask though is where you came up with the characters for the Cult of the Unwritten Book?
r/iama,"Hi, Mr. Morrison.  Thank you for your art and for doing this AMA.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a very creative person myself, so I'm fascinated by artists and the creative process. You're part of an amazing artistic scene that elevated genre literature in general, and DC comics &amp; Doctor Who tie-in fiction in particular, by being bold and experimental. And by taking genres and artforms that were generally looked down upon seriously. Yourself, Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Peter Milligan, Jamie Delano, Garth Ennis, Warren Ellis, Mike Carey, Clive Barker, Lawrence Miles, Lance Parkin, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of you knew each other; some of you didn't. Some of you were friends; some of you couldn't stand each other. But all of you, consciously or unconsciously, fed off of each other and pushed one another to create some of the greatest works of modern genre fiction. Your legacy, both as individuals and as a collective art scene, is staggering. What was it like to be part of that?"
r/iama,"Ehi Grant! Sorry for the silly question but... Is your wife the first one in world to know about your epic and amazing comics ideas? What does she think?
Thanks for everything, your stories really saved me. 
Ps. My boyfriend loves you and your works more than me, but it's ok if the other one is a special person like you."
r/iama,"Hi guys! I cant remember if this was covered in the show so far...but I need to know if Happy poops. And if so, what does he poop?

Thanks for everything!"
r/iama,"**Questions for Grant Morrison:**

* This one's not a question but a thank you. Big fan of yours! Your writing has helped me with dealing with depression and your creative use of story and especially language, specifically in your run of Doom Patrol, has sparked so much creative energy in me.  So thank you!
* **Do you know when the trade for Savage Sword of Jesus Christ is coming out?** Or did it come out already? Because it says it came out on Amazon but I don't know if it actually did since I can't find photographic evidence of it being released anywhere. :(
* Are there any licensed comics you enjoy or would love to explore with your writing?
* Would you ever return to The Wild Storm universe especially under the curation of Warren Ellis?
* Are there any Kirby comics you'd wanna do for the Kirby Genesis comics from Dynamite? 

**Questions for Patton Oswalt:**

* Would you write a Death Bed: The Bed That Eats comic book adaptation? Please and thank you.
* What comics are you currently reading?
* What's the one comic you think not many have read that should be read more?"
r/iama,"Mr Oswalt, recenly you played Dr Dementor in live action, what is it like playing physically a character you previous voice acted?"
r/iama,"Question for Patton. What's a role you auditioned for, really wanted, and didnt get, that was the most gut wrenching to miss out on?

Alternatively, what was your most excited ""you got the role"" moment in your career?"
r/iama,"Grant, huge fan here. I‚Äôm currently reading back through your Batman/Final Crisis run. I was particularly interested in the Clown at Midnight issue that relies more on prose than your typical comic book. After reading Supergods and coming back to this series, it‚Äôs hit me how good your prose is on its own. Have you considered writing a novel or collection of short stories?"
r/iama,What are you both looking forward to in the coming episodes of HAPPY?
r/iama,"Patton, whaaat is the coolest/ most memorable or humbling fan interaction you've had?"
r/iama,"Hi, this question for Grant.

I am a huge fan of your work, your Animal Man in particular being a favorite of mine, which influences my life in the way that I look at things like nature and the world around us and inspires me in my own stories. With that being said, I wanted to know out of all the comics you‚Äôve written, which one is your favorite or the one you‚Äôre most proud of?"
r/iama,Question for Grant: How long do you plan to be on Green Lantern?
r/iama,Are you still a [Joe Piscopo](https://tubitv.com/movies/327708/joe_piscopo_a_night_at_club_piscopo) fan?
r/iama,"Hey Patton, what is your favorite moments on both HAPPY! Season 1, and 2?"
r/iama,"Grant - If you could make one change to the Happy TV series, what would it be?

Patton - Do you get to improvise on the show? You have amazing talent as a voice-actor by the way!"
r/iama,"Hey Patton, how's it hanging? I eagerly bought two tickets to your show in Dublin in May before realising I can't actually go on the day. How offended will my mother be by the end of the show if I gift her the tickets?"
r/iama,Hi Grant! Can you suggest a magickal ritual that would help make Seaguy Eternal happen?
r/iama,"Ohmyscience you guys are *both* my favourites! One question for each:  

Grant Morrison: I love just about all of your work, but *Supergods* might actually be my favourite work of yours. For just one simple example: reading that was the first time I actually notice that comics were primarily written in ALL CAPS, but you had perceived that sort of instinctively, and made sure to incorporate that into all your relevant citations, in a way that really is (and I mean this in the most serious and technical way) genius. So: any plans to possibly follow up on *Supergods* with other works of non-fiction/criticism/autobiographical exploration or the like?  

Patton Oswalt: As a lauded member of the Comedians of Comedy, can you tell us something about Maria Bamford and/or Brian Posehn which real fans of theirs and yours (like myself) might not know (but which they would be comfortable with you sharing)? I feel like all of you guys are unusually honest and open in your work, so I'm always happy to learn something that I didn't actually know."
r/iama,"Hi Grant! I just wanted to express how much your work has affected me. I go back to reading the Final Crisis cycle constantly to pick myself up or feel inspired (I think it might be my favorite story ever), and All-Star Superman honestly changed my life. Not only did it make Superman my favorite superhero, it changed the way I look at how I interact with the world, and I can't thank you enough for that.

As for questions, what advice would you have for someone trying to get into comics today?

P.S. I can't wait for the Earth-20 crew to show up again, I saw Abin-Sur on a cover for The Green Lantern, and I'm super excited! Thanks for doing this, have a great day!"
r/iama,"Hi Grant! A couple of questions...

1.) What is one artist / character you haven't yet worked with yet that you'd like to?

2.) As a writer, what's the best way to begin making headway into the world of comics writing? What do you wish you'd known starting out?

Thank you for the many hours of enjoyment I've gotten from your work!"
r/iama,Patton: Do you regret making jokes about molesting children? Especially since you have a daughter? Has it had any effect on your professional life?
r/iama,"Is it possible (legally, technologically, ethically) to define news?   Before the 24 hr news cycle all news was more or less the same no matter the source.  It seemed verifiable if less prolific.  Now there is so much information that it's hard to tell news from opinion.  Throw in bad actors and it's impossible in any bubble.   So could a body exist that proactively defined news?"
r/iama,"I believe that the long term solution is to teach critical thinking in high school so that students begin learning how to tell the difference between ""fake news"" and reality. Do you think this is workable? Can these skills be taught?"
r/iama,How do you avoid research bias? How can you keep your personal beliefs separate from the actual results?
r/iama,"In India we're witnessing riots and genocide because of fake news and propoganda videos, what measures you can suggest to counter their spread?"
r/iama,How well are you able to quantify a level of difference in the amount of 'fake news' coming out of the major networks? Who would you say is the worst culprit of the bunch?
r/iama,What is the best way to find accurate news?
r/iama,Is there an easy way to recognize propaganda and/or fake news? How can I teach myself to be alert on misinformation?
r/iama,"Does reading factually incorrect ‚Äúnews‚Äù have an impact on people‚Äôs perceptions, even if they already knew it wasn‚Äôt true when read/listening/watching it?"
r/iama,"If you had to summarize the traditional ""propaganda path"" that information takes when the powers-that-be want the public to believe something, what would that look like?

I often note that when the U.S. wants to go to war, for example, articles in the major media outlets progressively dehumanize the proposed enemy in the lead up to any political decisions. First they're found killing Christians, for example, then they're found raping all the women, then they're killing babies by throwing them out hospital windows, and so on.

Has your research covered anything like this?"
r/iama,What can a student journalist do better learn how to verify a story or track it back to the source?
r/iama,"Do you look at the ""fake news"" historically, such as in other mediums, such as newspapers, radio, newsreels and television? I would image there are similarities, even though it might have been called something else."
r/iama," Do you think we‚Äôre behind Russia in understanding propaganda?  I heard they had whole departments of philology devoted to its production.  I feel like in the west we didn‚Äôt take the threat seriously enough and largely left it to the advertising and Pr industries to put forward the positive aspects of western society - industries that in themselves lead to a sort of demoralisation.   

I know that you can‚Äôt really counter propaganda with propaganda as you risk stooping to the enemy‚Äôs level and becoming undemocratic, but do you think we need to lose some of our scruples in the face of threats such as the internet that can completely hack someone‚Äôs mind?  I hear people say education is the answer, but this too can be seen as propagandistic."
r/iama,What do you think of Singapores anti-fake news bill ?
r/iama,How do we suppress or debunk fake news spread through social media during an election cycle?
r/iama,"Hey Professor, i am studying mass comm at King‚Äôs College, any advice for any future college graduates?"
r/iama,Kind of irrelevant but thoughts on MKUltra and MkNaomi?
r/iama,"How would you go about communicating about epistemologies of ignorance, in a way that doesn't require a deep literature background for the audience? In other words: How would you exposit to a general audience the ""signature features"" of epistemologies of ignorance?"
r/iama,"As a PR practitioner, do you ever feel the urge to spin a story (press release) into something that it isn't to make it more newsworthy? How do you combat this?"
r/iama,"There seems to be a lot of money involved in producing clickbait news or biased news compared to more objective news. Do you think that's because people prefer a more convenient half truth than one that could be inconvenient? If so, how do you combat that? News providers generally get their funding through advertisements and they'll go where the most eyeballs are.

Sorry if that was phrased weird!"
r/iama,What legal/regulatory policies would help curtail digital propaganda without eroding free speech?
r/iama,How do you feel about Chomsky's *Manufacturing Consent* and how do you incorporate it into your own work?
r/iama,"Do you believe it is ever ethical to manipulate the media, such as hiding the name of a mass murderer or if the government limits information flow during a crisis to reduce panic? I imagine as someone teaching strategic communications at a college you get a lot of students who might eventually use that knowledge with ulterior motives or controversial gray areas."
r/iama,Is there a lot of fake news involved with most of the mainstream news outlets aka Fox40/CNN/ABC new?
r/iama,"Do you believe that the motivation for these attacks on the media have anything to do with a concerted effort to undermine the free press?

I recognize some of the weakness in the above proposal, such as (i) free speech concerns and (ii) whether a viewer of news is actually a consumer.  Regarding the first weakness - and again - without having done any research - I imagine this would not be a strong challenge since the speech is not restricted, simply how it is presented to the viewers.  Regarding the second weakness, I imagine an easy workaround to this is establishing a separate agency that can establish, monitor, and enforce the designation of ""news programs"".  

Just curious on your thoughts."

Joking aside, thanks for doing this!

A while back, I heard about plans (perhaps more of a vision, really) to use machine learning to identify propaganda and fake news. Are you aware of a project like this, or even using it in your own? I would very much like to know how far along those capabilities are today."

Second question, even after sharing data like [the fact that you'd have to work 119 hours a week at minimum wage to afford to rent a 2 bedroom apartment in California](https://reports.nlihc.org/oor), people nitpick (""I have a problem with this data because they say you shouldn't spend more than a third of your income on housing"") and then dismiss the entire issue.

r/iama,"What's your take on the decline of journalistic ethics, and left-leaning propaganda/fake news sites like Huffpost, Vox, Nowthis, buzzfeed etc? 

I noticed a serious decline in the quality of journalism around 2012. Seems that's when people really started cutting cords and migrating away from TV/print into online news. That reduced profitability of traditional outlets while we were inundated with a massive oversupply of liberal arts majors - all trained to churn out text and not much else. Bush's bankruptcy reform bill in 05' guaranteed student loan repayment by barring bankruptcy on student loans, which in turn guaranteed loans would be handed out, which led to a huge increase in college enrollment, increased tuition price, and decreased quality of education as schools scrambled to hire more professors they lowered the bar. I saw this happen personally, as I was grad class of 08'. The first round of ""loan kids"" graduated in 2010, by 2012/2013 that generation was populating the news media and that's when things really went downhill. 

Seems like from the left right wing and conspiracy theory ""fake"" news gets alot of attention, and on the right they seem to be focused on CNN/MSNBC. 

But I've seen a hell of alot of propaganda coming from the left too, i call it ""virtue bait"". Political equivalents of cat videos, that make you feel warm inside or inspire you to dislike a nefarious actor, often both at the same time.

r/iama,"It seems to me that one of the biggest problems in the ""News"" nowadays is the constant peddling of opinion stories as fact, or the interjection of opinion into stories that are not in the editorial section, effectively blurring the lines between the ""news"" and the ""opinion"" sections.

r/iama,"We're drowning in data and struggling to make sense of it all. How do we reveal fakeness or bias when data-intensive topics are subjective to deep analyses that take time and effort to distill, and even more time and effort for non-technical journalists to grasp?  


One prime example: inequality and economic mobility research. While most of the headlines talk about how bad it is, a lot of research papers that dive deep have shown how sensitive the results are to what \_type\_ of data is collected, and how simple demographic decisions like marriage rates play a massive role in what inequality looks like. The sensitivity to inputs can almost completely change the public narrative, and I find that in general, that level of nuance is missing from reporting. Is that a bias problem, a fake-news problem, a lack of expertise problem, or something else?   


Put another way, how can we ensure journalists are empowered to accurately report and update reports in a world where very technical details matter more and more?"

This has gotten to the point that a minority of our producers and journalists have become so afraid of drawing negative social media reactions, that they suggest trying to approach the presentation of objective facts with the sensitivities of our audience as something that should be considered.

Is ‚Äúfake news‚Äù purely reports of what is not factual, or could the label apply to linguistic workarounds of uncomfortable topics designed to suit the audience that reads them?

Everyone seems to be making hay out of the quote that the investigation could not establish a conspiracy, and expecting that the evidence might be quite strong but just not beyond a reasonable doubt. However, it seems like the evidence of such a conspiracy with the IRA and GRU might be rather thin, and there may be yet another letdown on Thursday for Trump critics.

One of the more tantalizing threads of the last couple of years were a pair of McClatchy articles: [one in April](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article208870264.html) stating that Mueller had evidence Cohen was in Prague, and [one later in December characterizing this evidence](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article219016820.html) as cell phone pings to towers around Prague and intercepts of GRU communications referring to Cohen in Prague. 

McClatchy is a respected outlet, but they remain on an island on this story all the way up to the present day. No one else ever corroborated, and the two authors (Peter Stone and Greg Gordon) have now left McClatchy, although neither article has been retracted.

But you mentioned at one point that other outlets [were ""close"" to corroborating](https://twitter.com/ScottMStedman/status/1078342329910550533). Since then, Michael Cohen has continued to emphatically deny ever being in Prague, and it would be astonishing if Mueller wrapped up without having running this to ground. It seems virtually certain the Cohen/Prague allegation in the dossier was bad intel, as were the intercepted GRU communications referenced by McClatchy.

Do you agree? If so, what do you think happened here?

Best of luck with your book."

r/iama,"First off, congrats on the book - I'll definitely check it out; and thank you for serving the good of our country in your own way.

My number one question I guess would be how were you able to accomplish what you've done at such a young age? My interpretation of journalism as an institution, and especially investigative journalism, is that success is largely dependent on your sources. The more/better sources a reporter has, the more access they have to information that would otherwise be unavailable to them. That said, I guess my question then is has the work you've done been dependent on highly placed sources? If so, how were you able to cultivate these relationships and the requisite trust so early in your career? And if not, where/how did you get the majority of your information from? Given that your work ended up leading to subpoenas, action from Congress, and in the hands of the Special Counsel I assume you either beat other reporters from more established outlets (ie the NYT, WaPo, etc.) to the punch, or had knowledge they didn't. 

Either way I cant wait to check out your book!

r/iama,"Investigative journalism has played a huge role in revealing large portions of the Trump/Russia relationship already. It'll continue to play a significant role in the future, including anything that involves the redaction (and hopefully, eventually, full public release) of the Mueller report.

But I think it's important that people view reporters and sources with a critical eye. The reporters who have a long history of investigative journalism, who have shown the ability to pull documents and read them with a critical eye, and who have an impeccably accurate record are the ones we should trust the most.

So color me skeptical that your book is truly investigative. You've admitted that you've never worked in a newsroom. Your credentials are a blog and a couple of co-published freelance articles. At 23, you've hardly had the world experience many of your potential peers have had.

Your publisher - Skyhorse Publishing - is a haven for conspiracy theories. As of 2014, it had published [35 books on JFK's assassination](https://www.vqronline.org/books/jfk-still-dead-another-historiographical-moment). It published [a book by Roger Stone](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/09/roger-stone-book-trump-bill-clinton-hillary-rapist/) that attacked the Clintons. 

Why is this important? While it's true that authors should be allowed to explore all possibilities in the search for truth, there is [no real editing or oversight](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/09/why-books-still-arent-fact-checked/378789/) of books like there is in newspaper and magazine newsrooms.

Fusion GPS in turn hired Christopher Steele, a former British MI6 operative with sources among Russian government officials. The result was the salacious dossier, whose sources included ‚Äúa senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure‚Äù and ‚Äúa former top level intelligence officer still active in the Kremlin.‚Äù Steele‚Äôs work was paid for by Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. That means a paid agent of the Clinton campaign approached Russian officials for damaging material on Trump.‚Äù

r/iama,"During the course of the 2016 campaign, it was revealed that the DNC servers were compromised by a simple phishing attack which wouldn't require sophisticated hacking, much less ""collusion"" or collaboration between a major entity like Russia and Trump's campaign. Moreover, the contents of the hack were revealed to be more compelling anyway. Hard evidence of the DNC conspiring to undemocratically bury a popular primary contender in Bernie Sanders, as well as collusion between Clinton's campaign and some media entities like CNN, in order to prop up her own campaign as well as prop up ""dummy candidates"" like Trump (who they felt was the easiest to beat head to head). The contents of this hack were hardly publicized and quickly forgotten in favor of a sudden lurch towards accusing Trump himself of being behind this attack, and the combined weight of media attention focused on ""how"" this happened, rather than what was uncovered (which was seriously incriminating). In the meantime, the FBI opted not to investigate the servers at the time, and were dismissive up until the date of Trump's election. Obama and Clinton themselves were dismissing Trump's open concerns about the potential for election rigging a week or so before the date of the election, and there was no major campaign to hammer or investigate Trump for potential collusion. Indeed, it was later revealed Trump's campaign was under FISA surveillance, among other things (like an enormous amount of media scrutiny and attempts to dig up dirt on him, such as the infamous ""pussy grabbing"" tape that was supposed to end his bid in October). If he were conducting illicit activity in hopes of rigging the election, it would have been easily apparent, and that seems to have been understood by people who were hardly worried about him at the time.

So what changed, after the improbable happened, and he *was* elected, Scott? Why the sudden, mounting hysterics, and claims of collusion and rigging in the weeks after? The investigation that gave carte blanche to Mueller, endless resources, and the ability to scour every nook and cranny of Trump's conduct and background, for *two years*, didn't reveal anything that would hold up in court or be indictable. So what was behind the concerted campaign to accuse him of this act following his election and what was the justification for such a massive, intrusive prosecutorial investigation? I'm guessing your book is full of much of the same flimsy, circumstantial justification that establishment media cobbled together following the election fall-out to create the initial spin. Anything to deflect from the fact that the hard evidence would suggest *they* were complicit in colluding with a major Presidential campaign such as Clinton's and actively harmed Sanders and the fair democratic process at large. But Russian memes on Facebook, right?"

People like you inspire me so much, I (mid 20s American male) suffer from a decent amount of mental and physical disabilities and there is so much I struggle with, but lately it seems like a huge amount of my time is spent on wrestling with the depressing turn of events that's befallen our precious communities, how it feels like our government is not just incompetent but at times malicious and self destructive and if we could ever make things right for the millions of people whose property, health, rights and lives have been damaged or destroyed as a result. One of the few things that gives me relief is knowing there are people like you out there who can do what I can't and spend their time fighting for the good of all of us.

r/iama,"The ole Trump Tower meeting...

It's a nothingburger. They admit seeking dirt. The word dirt is subjective. People like you want people to think 'dirt' is some illegal covert documents. You know what else is dirt? A video of Hillary eating as booger. Or her calling a staffer the N word. Neither of those is illegal. 

Since we already know nothing illegal was obtained....

One would have to know what the 'dirt' is before you can even speculate what would have been done. Hillary eating a booger? You post the shit out of it. What if its some super duper ultra top secret documents obtained from her hacked bathroom server? You take that to the FBI. You don't know what would have been done and you should man up and admit it. I know that would be tough to do since you've wasted years of your life....

I have heard the argument that although the Barr Memo quotes a line from the Mueller Report saying there was no collusion between the Trump Campaign and  the Rusian Government, that it could be the real collusion was between the Trump Campaign and Russian oligarchs.

Is there any reasonableness to this?"

Is potency the same as activity?  The Padua variant of the FIX protein has been described as six to eight times more active than the wild type FIX protein.  Is this an apples to apples comparison?  Does this mean that a 5IU/kg dose of dalcinonacog alfa will raise my FIX level to ~100%?

Does the increased half-life of dalcinonacog alfa stem from the fact that it is administered subq or from some other characteristic of the protein?

Let's not bury the lede here... Are these as awkward as I imagine?"
r/iama,"Oh man, this is a good time in my life to become aware of this.

I have some nasty trust issues, a lot of them sexual, and as a result I have a tendency to be really jealous in and after relationships. In my head, it doesn't make sense to put sexual expression in a box (be it monogamy or vanilla or whatever) but when I'm confronted with the realities of someone sharing this special thing that was intimate and *ours* and means so much to me with someone else, I get real emotional, just this horrible sick feeling, like the world is ending. Nowadays I am so afraid of that feeling that I don't even give physical intimacy and letting people in a chance. The after effects of a really religious upbringing, I guess, but I've left that life behind and I still feel it, like it's a fact of my biology. I feel so repressed and ashamed.

Is there anything you would recommend to a young man starting this journey? Things you had wish you had known or done differently? The biggest thing that concerns me is when I select from the variety of jobs that are available upon entering the Air Force, I imagine being any kind of aircraft mechanic, or an engineer would be the best job experience I could have before I'm a pilot, and ultimately try to get selected by NASA, but a few other jobs, such as SERE and Linguistics are very attractive to me as well.

Why should a school pay that much for a system that can be evaded by a $5 duffle bag? How much more warning are we really going to get here because the first gun shot is a warning in itself. What about false alarms? How many false alarms will it take before schools scrap the system? Tracking the individual would be useful after the shooting starts, but that can be done with a human watching a Wi-Fi feed.

Why school systems? This and  the heart string H1-B visa story is why I'm suspicious and everyone else should be suspicious. The US government likely has worked with gun identifying AI before and this is not new technology. I imagine your goal is **marketing** your version and you have crafted a story to sell a ""monorail"" to a system of dumb and fearful voters who don't understand why this system is a waste of money. 

Congratulations on embracing US capitalism."

r/iama,"The software engineer in me wants to flame you for stating you use AI instead of just saying you use machine learning, but I expect someone else will do that soon anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

So here ~~is an actual question~~ are some actual questions.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your plans for dealing with errors? Detecting a firearm in a building(especially a school) carries an immense amount of importance. A false positive would send the building into complete lockdown and a false negative would make your company look horrible and possible carry some personal guilt.

&amp;#x200B;

You say currently(understandably in the early phases) that a false positive occurs in 1 of 1,000,000 frames. Is that literally every 1mil frames processed will ""sound the alarm""? My highschool had 45 cameras in it and at 24fps that is a false positive every 10 minutes. I saw you said you are currently aiming for a false positive every 10 million frames, but that would still be a false alarm every 150ish minutes. Do you have any plans/ideas for how to deal with your scaling issue? The more cameras you add the higher the false positive frequency so covering a large building seems impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: I figured this argument would start. Yes machine learning is a subset of AI. We get that and I am not denying that. However claiming that you use AI implies that you have **all** the capability of an artificially intelligent system, which a machine learning system does not have."
r/iama,Why not try to bring this Tech to South Africa/Africa?  Microsoft looking for business cases (remote medicine as one example?)
r/iama,"I understand the struggle and I apologise in advance if this sounds harsh. Here it goes. 

Firstly there is a lack of information regarding the technical side of your product which I am not pleased with. 

Secondly, I am unfortunately not a believer of a product like this. A good scanner at the entrance and a armed security guard will prevent the majority of these nutcases. And with the cost of this camera system that thinking pattern is further reinforced since you could comfortably put multiple armed guards with shotguns which would be much more effective.

Disregarding the extremely high cost. If this product was sold as a system and not as a subscription it'd be more reasonable, what happens when the schools budget gets a cut down two years down the line? Since these camera's cost _hundreds of thousands of dollars per school_ are they supposed to compromise on education so that they can retain this system?

From a technical perspective, What you are doing with your product is not something difficult to demand such a high price.

If you for instance made a plug in for the many surveillance software out there or customize an open source one to be able to detect guns and do the very few other things you do, I think that's better. That is good because then I can also roll whatever camera and server hardware I please rather than going with whatever hardware you put. 

Finally I know it sounds nice but try not put irrelevant personal feelgood stories in your product pitches. It's not professional, but I get it, for reddit I might give a pass however there was zero relevance to the product in this case. 

Lastly if you got the right political connections, your in for a lot of money I can tell you that. With that said, good luck and please reconsider pricing and publish on the technicalities so that I might be able to retake what I said and see the bright side."
r/iama,"‚ÄúAverages one false positive per week.‚Äù

How many cameras are you monitoring? It seems super high and would be a huge problem if you‚Äôre able to scale."
r/iama,"If you were 100% successful you'd reduce gun deaths in the US by a minuscule amount. There's nothing wrong with that, but what does it have to do with your backstory of dealing with street violence in SA? The equivalent in the US is gang and drug gun deaths, mostly with handguns."
r/iama,So let‚Äôs say that 1 false positive a week occurs in a school environment. How does an administration check each of these situations efficiently without being disruptive? I remember school - something like that could be seen as a way to look badass without repercussions. What about protest entities that are trying to get attention by holding up a suspicious items? What feedback are you getting from administrations on the management aspect of this?

r/iama,Have you ever read 1984?
r/iama,Lots of people love to throw around the word 'AI' and most of the time it's inaccurate. Can you describe some of the technologies and algorithms you are using at an in-industry level?
r/iama,"Why are you storing video 24 hours? It sounds like you only need the ""real time"" feed and the detected frames"
r/iama,So I'm in this business.  There are so many companies doing this right now.  Why would a school system choose you over Avigilon who has significantly more experience in the world of analytics and has already deeply penetrated that market?  (Not trying to be a jerk.  It's a legitimate question.)
r/iama,the shameless self promotion lol.  who upvotes this shit?
r/iama,H1B is supposed to be to fill jobs that nobody can do in this country.  And it paid $12/hr?  Definitely sounds like abuse of the program.
r/iama,How many if statements does it take to technically count as AI?
r/iama,"What did your mother do? We tend to think that these are bad, low-paying jobs that we give to immigrants, but $12/hour is almost double what I was making as a \~20 year-old citizen in 1999."
r/iama,"What happens in a ""good guy with a gun"" scenario where police instead get routed to the good guy defensively positioned and he gets gunned down because that's how police are? Is your company liable at all?"
r/iama,"There's nothing any tech can do to stop a motivated person. I think what you are doing is ultimately more dangerous than what you are trying to stop. If you asked British people of a certain era, we Americans were ""active shooters and terrorists. What about SA and that nightmare? The citizens of SA now hire armed  private security to guard and police because the govt cops can't be trusted or are incompetent."
r/iama,"So basically it has no real world value, just hypothetically?"
r/iama,Why did you spend 4 paragraphs on the overwrought and heart-rending backstory which has absolutely no connection to the product you are peddling here?
r/iama,How could she get an H1B visa where she only gets paid $12 an hour? This smells of fraud
r/iama,"&gt;My mother decided to take a leap of faith and bring me and my sister to the United States on an H-1B visa paying a meager wage

&gt;a meager wage

If $12/hr was a meager wage 20 years ago, what is it now?  Pretty much every gas station, fast food place, retail chain, and other unskilled professions in the Midwest will start you at or below $12 in 2019."
r/iama,Is it frustrating knowing that your tech is completely pointless?
r/iama,"
1) $20 per camera. Any reasonably sized school would need hundreds of cameras to even remotely have a chance at getting an AI-recognizable image of someone holding a gun. Talking minimum $4000/month per school. That's great for you guys, I guess?

2) False positives - there's no way you're weeding those out entirely, of course, but... How are you working to minimize the number of false positives?

3) Even assuming this works 100% as advertised, how does it actually help anyone? The gunshots are a pretty clear indicator that a shooting is happening, and they generally happen about at the same time that the guns are removed from the car/bag/locker/etc. How does your product actually intend to help? Can you show that having the information you intend to make available is more effective than a ""run away from the gunshot sounds"" strategy?

Overall I feel that your product is the perfect example of something birthed in a business school rather than a tech school. Is there anything you have to say that would dissuade me of this notion?

Sorry to be harsh but, if you want to make it as a company in the security world you will need to get used to such harsh questions."

Glad you‚Äôre finally getting the recognition you deserve, but honestly, I‚Äôve always loved your oddball indies veering across all genres like Joshua, Choke, or The Winning Season. You always find ways to elevate them.

Anyway, my question is over 1998‚Äôs Jerry And Tom. I feel this is never talked about even though it‚Äôs one of the best late-90s QT knock-offs imo. Do you have any cool stories about the making of this gem? What‚Äôs your own feelings on it? My dad and I watched this on IFC back in the day and it‚Äôs still one of our shared favs. Really hope you improv-ed the chainsaw scene (‚ÄúFuck Black And Decker!‚Äù ‚ÄúBlack AND Decker can come here and suck my dick!‚Äù).

The bridge of ""the cycle of rebirth"": the main building at the white temple, the ubosot, is reached by crossing a bridge over a small lake.

Next to the lake stand two very elegant Kinnaree, half-human, half-bird creatures from Buddhist mythology.[3]"

He knocked the dish off of the counter when we weren‚Äôt home and basically inhaled the chicken. HE IS OKAY. As many of you know, chicken bones can be dangerous when cooked. Thankfully he passed them no problem and spends his days thinking about his next opportunity.

It takes a lot of training when they're young though.

r/gifs,"I've played football for a decade and this pisses me off so much. Proper football to me is turning up at a local park on a cold and drizzly winter morning and then going on to a pitch with countless divots in to battle it out with the opposition. Fuckin good shoulder to shoulder competition, tackles where you slide for 10ft through the mud and one player a game getting socked right in the face by a wet ball that the defenders tried to slam down the pitch.

Then you get this poncy display that's getting pretty close to being non-contact football. Used to love watching professional games on TV but it's just got horrendously bad for this shit."
r/gifs,Soccer really needs a rule that if you're caught faking an injury like that you get banned. Three in a season means permanent ban from the sport. Can be proven with cameras even if the ref doesn't call it.
r/gifs,I was dying laughing.
r/gifs,that ref shacking his head near the end says it all.

Repeat it and you get Red cards. 

Repeat across 3 or 4 games and you get a season ban

Oh, and first offense, if you're *this* injured that you're rolling on the ground writhing in pain, you're relieved from the game and cannot come back and your team pays for taking you to ER immediately."

r/gifs,"Love playing soccer, hate watching it"
r/gifs,Pretty easy to fix. Anyone who found faking will be banned for next three games. Doesn't have to be referreed in game.
r/gifs,"the lack of knowledge regarding football in this thread is quite scary.

This has literally fuck all to do with the toughness, strength, manliness or any other way you want to put it. The fact is, its the most competative sport in the world, especially when it comes to the English leagues. I am in no way saying its right, it's downright cheating, but they do things like this to try to gain an advantage. Getting an opposing player sent off, or even on a yellow card (meaning if they get another yellow card this game they get sent off. Having a player on a yellow card can be really bad, as it will encourage the other team to make their faster more skillful players try to draw a foul of that person to get them sent off.) can almost win you the game alone.

Its laughable when it gets compared to women's football, rugby, American football or any other sport. There's a reason its the most popular sport in the world, and that fact alone puts enough pressure onto players to make them think that they need to do this kind of thing."

r/gifs,"Should be a rule that if you roll around like that dude at the end then you are out for the rest of the game.   You know, for his health and safety.   Don‚Äôt want to aggravate that super serious injury."
r/gifs,"They should just make it if you really are that injured you are out for two games to recover.

Or fine people for flopping.

Or red card them.

Do something.  This is fucking stupid."

r/gifs,It‚Äôs PATHETIC
r/gifs,"I teach at an international school in China, and one of the students there is from Brazail because his dad is on the local team or something. Anyway we have soccer class every week and the first week he was there they were playing a game and he barely gets touched and flops down grabbing his shin wincing in pain. 
Problem is he got touched in the arm. He notices no one is watching him and gets up and proceeds to try and flop like 5 more times in the game. BTW this kid is like 5 years old. Must have learned how to flop from his dad."
r/gifs,"Treat it like a horse race. If someone falls on the ground, two little men with a tent and a bolt gun come out."

r/gifs,I love how they all throw their hands up the same way when the other one pretends to fall down.

This morning in fact, yet again, one of my younger red ear sliders, Hurricane, launched herself out of her aquarium. As I walked up to her to put her back in her tank, she took off like a rocket and tried to run under a table to get away from me. She was faster than the turtle in this gif! I still caught her, and put her back in her tank. No, she has never been injured from doing this.

For you turtle keepers out there, she's not gravid. She's large enough to be gravid, but this has been Hurricane's thing her entire life. She's very energetic, lol. I'm often awakened to a loud CLANG between 2:00 am and 3:00 am every morning, from Hurricane flinging her river rocks around."

&gt; An Improvised Explosive Device detected near Katunayake Airport &amp; disposed in controlled explosion at site by SLAF EOD Personnel.- Sri Lanka Airforce

https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-sri-lanka-attacks-airport-14443149

**AFP News Agency quoting police: Eighth blast hits Sri Lankan capital.**

Sri Lanka announces nationwide curfew, starting at 6 p.m., after series of attacks
Sri Lanka has shut down social media and messaging services in the country

8  suspects arrested although several people were questioned. 

&gt; Reports on Sri Lankan TV speak of 7th explosion a few moments ago in Sri Lanka at a Hotel near Dehiwala zoo

This probably is the worst terrorist attack in Sri Lanka (in recent memory).

**so far 215 people dead and some 500+ injured (count will rise)**

Preliminary reports suggest there were 6 terrorist attacks; so far 2 attackers have been identified.

&gt; Two of the six attacks that rocked Sri Lanka this morning are reportedly to be have been carried out by suicide bombers. The attack at Shangri La hotel was carried out by suicide bomber Zahran Hashim, while Abu Mohammad has been identified as the attacker at the Batticalao church.

From BBC

&gt; No group has yet said it was responsible for the attacks.

&gt; There have been fears that Islamic State group fighters returning from the Middle East could pose a threat in the country.

&gt; In the years since the end of Sri Lanka's civil war in 2009, there has been some sporadic violence, with members of the majority Buddhist Sinhala community attacking mosques and Muslim-owned properties. That led to a state of emergency being declared in March 2018.
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48001720

**UPDATE**

reporting from AFP

Sri Lanka's police chief made a nationwide alert 10 days before Sunday's bomb attacks in the country that suicide bombers planned to hit ""prominent churches"", according to the warning seen by AFP.

Police chief Pujuth Jayasundara sent an intelligence warning to top officers on April 11 setting out the threat.
""A foreign intelligence agency has reported that the NTJ (National Thowheeth Jama'ath) is planning to carry out suicide attacks targeting prominent churches as well as the Indian high commission in Colombo,"" said the alert.

The NTJ is a radical Muslim group in Sri Lanka that came to notice last year when it was linked to the vandalization of Buddhist statues.

2) Women's reproductive rights

3) Gay rights

4) Freedom of Religion

r/news,so if education continues down this path why do we need teachers?
r/news,"Isn't the Summit program by large already how education works? This is the expectation from my experience at all stages of education and academics for the 'traditional way'.

Even in high school or once you get to college, it almost completely becomes all self taught and self driven. Professors will simply instruct to read the book, find your own resources or you end up having to resort to these other resources anyways..you tube, khan academy, chegg, course hero etc.

Professors and teachers don't teach nearly as efficient as they should or lack the skills to. We also have to consider that even if they have the teaching skills? Students are all performing on different levels and there's no correct way to standardize education or heck help every single person.

So the Summit system actually sounds like it's trying to help students get that personalized education a lot of people have been wanting. I think it sounds great and perhaps people are just resistant towards change.

As far as feeling isolated and alone...oh how these high school students will feel when they get to college. They're going to wake up at 8AM to do assignments, attend class, eat, work, sleep at 2AM and wake back up at 8AM to repeat. Wait this is already my everyday life just working a job...

Edit: I pulled up the [complaint itself](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/14864956/pugh-v-erdos/) and it doesn‚Äôt have this number in it. It asks for the following as relief:

&gt; a. Full and fair compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by a jury; b. Punitive damages in an amount to be determined by a jury; c. Reasonable attorney‚Äôs fees and costs of this action; and d. Any such other relief as appears just and proper.

Edit 2: The article is wrong. $75,000 is the [minimum for federal jurisdiction](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1332). The reporter must‚Äôve seen ‚Äúat least $75,000‚Äù checked off somewhere and thought it was the amount being sued for.

Edit 3: as others have pointed out, the $75,000 is irrelevant here because it‚Äôs a federal question case (complaint cites 28 USC 1331, not 1332). So God knows where the reporter got $75k."

Misappropriation of police resources for intentional reasons (e.g. swatting) tends to be already covered by other laws, but if it's not in a particular locale, then any law made to do so should not include race.

Just so many potential issues here."

I say 'try' because even if you're sure that this happens constantly and needs to be stopped, imagine having to *prove* the motivations of one particular call beyond a reasonable doubt. Unless it's the world's most senile racist and the 911 transcript is 'I have a black guy to report...yeah, he's just standing there, being black. Come quick!"", it's not going to happen."

The idea that any law would suggest making exceptions to the accountability of an individual based on race is appalling.

r/news,Does this apply to black people calling 911 on other black people? So if you‚Äôre white you could tell a black person what you saw and have him make the decision on calling 911 or not?
r/news,"Past Saturday in Oakland as I was walking through a park minding my own business a large black man came up to me, spat in my face, started punching me and trying to steal my phone. He gave me a serious concussion I‚Äôve been in bed for all week (still am now) and I had to bite his wrist to prevent him from robbing me.

My white friend (I am also white) told me that it was ‚Äúso caucasian‚Äù of me to call the police on this man and essentially thinks because he‚Äôs black and homeless, because of *historical racism* I can‚Äôt do a bloody thing about, that it‚Äôs worse for me as a white person to get this man off the streets than to let him keep spitting, nearly killing, and nearly robbing people. This law will revolve around the opinions of superiors that may be so saturated with ‚Äúwhite guilt‚Äù that criminals will be at an advantage. I‚Äôm almost positive he saw me as a small and *white* and was targeted for those specific reasons.

On that note, I myself was homeless at 17 and worked out of it. When I couldn‚Äôt afford to live in the city where my family and I were historically from I moved to somewhere my dollar had more power until I rose myself up- didn‚Äôt blame it on something ridiculous like ‚Äúgentrification‚Äù and using my heritage to claim false ownership to an entire city (like Oakland, CA) that is literally run by people of color and embraces diversity.

How are undocumented immigrants getting access to HUD assistance?  And, why would anyone be opposed to turning off housing assistance for undocumented immigrants?  Our legal immigrants and citizens really should get a priority here.

So, taking away benefits from people who do qualify instead of prorating as is the current practice. Sounds about right for this administration."

The capsule involved is said to be the one used for demonstration mission 1 that docked with the International Space Station in March, and was being prepared for the in flight abort test that was to occur this summer.  Had that test gone well, SpaceX might have been on track to launch the first ever commercial crew mission to the International Space Station before the end of the year.  Anonymous sources are saying that the capsule was completely destroyed.  It is possible the failure is related to the fuel tanks, which would be a serious design setback requiring a lot of time to prove a fix before the vehicle is rated safe for crew.  The capsule intended for the first crewed launch would likely be moved up to the in flight abort test, and another one under construction be prepared for the crewed flight.

Nothing is confirmed yet. Hopefully we will hear more soon.  This capsule did splash down in the ocean and was recovered.  There is no news on specifically what was being tested."
