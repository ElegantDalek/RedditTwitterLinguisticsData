My district manager hired an assistant manager for my store without telling me she was even interviewing anyone. She was hired and just showed up one day to start work without me knowing anything. The person she hired was well known in the mall. She wasn’t allowed in half of it due to a restraining order from her previous store. I was livid.\\n      Complained to HR.

Or would spend time wandering the part of the mall she was still allowed in.\\n\\n      I was never allowed to write her up. I was supposedly causing a hostile work environment.

       " \"This is going to be a long one so buckle up?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have 2 stories, one from my father in law (who is still alive) and the other is from my great aunt in law who passed away last year.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI've been with my husband for 15 years. My husband's father got diagnosed about 8 or so years ago. Before, he's always had memory troubles but he was the most pleasant person I've ever met. As things got worse, he got more angry. Once the official Alzheimer's diagnosis got attached, he was put on some medication and that helped for a long while. (He's on different meds now that the disease has progressed.)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe great aunt in law was also very pleasant, up until about a year before she died. She then used to curse out my mother in law (it was her mother's sister who also was like... her second mother, basically as the great aunt had no children. Mother in law promised she'd take care of her in her dying years, and she did just that.) on a regular basis which made the mother in law both stressed out and sad. On top of taking care of the great aunt and her husband, she was (and still is) working. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAbout a year and a half ago we picked up our family and moved out to where the in laws were to at first help my mother in law take care of the great aunt, but it has blossomed to help take care of my father in law too as he has had some severe drops since we moved here. Towards the end with the great aunt, she didn't remember what year it was, and didn't recognize me or my children. Still, I wouldn't have changed experiencing that for the world. She was 99, with 3 months before turning 100 when she died. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI've always really enjoyed speaking with my father in law; however now he doesn't say much. He can't really handle more than a couple of people around. He sleeps quite a bit, and shakes more than he used to. He also used to get really angry which was uncharacteristic of him. Thankfully, whatever current meds he's on has been helping with that, the nightmares, and the hallucinations.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe've talked to my husband's other siblings and they all agree that they're glad someone in the family is taking the helm at watching the parents. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt's really a tough job taking care of someone you love who doesn't remember who you are, or who doesn't behave the way they used to. On top of that, the cognitive dysfunction and sometimes the outright combativeness of the loved one can really wear on someone. I think it's imperative to have others come in and at least give the primary caregiver a break; or have an ear for them to vent at without judgement. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy mother in law has said that she is in mourning for the person that was my father in law but isn't anymore. They'll be celebrating their 50th anniversary in June.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThanks OP for posting this. I appreciate it. &lt;3\",\n",

They started out mainly specializing in rice but also do a ton of cooking oil and some other common products in China.  He climbed the ranks until he was in charge of distribution for Chongqing, one of the largest cities in the world.  His job, basically, boiled down to figuring out how to bribe grocery store chain owners to putting his company's products in prime shelving space, and figuring out how to bribe local factories and farming conglomerates to lower their prices for his company relative to the competition.  This mainly consisted in metric fuck tons of KTV whores, baijiu (Chinese hard liquor), tobacco, drugs, especially Ketamine in his time, and assisting with money laundering schemes (mainly real estate and stock market trickery).  He had 16 hour days, 6-7 days a week of nothing but drinking, whoring, drug dealing, embezzlement, and endless ass kissing and getting his own ass kissed.\\n\\nHe burned out of that in less than 2 years once he finally reached the position he had worked his ass off 8 years to get.

In rare cases, infants are born with genetic surfactant deficiency, resulting in rapid death from respiratory failure. Because of the immediate perinatal fatality associated with this disease, any effective intervention would need to be applied before delivery. Alapati et al. used a mouse model of genetic surfactant deficiency to demonstrate the feasibility of in utero gene editing to delete the mutant allele. The authors showed that correction of the genetic defect before birth improved lung development and survival in the treated animals, demonstrating the feasibility of this therapeutic intervention.\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nMonogenic lung diseases that are caused by mutations in surfactant genes of the pulmonary epithelium are marked by perinatal lethal respiratory failure or chronic diffuse parenchymal lung disease with few therapeutic options. Using a CRISPR fluorescent reporter system, we demonstrate that precisely timed in utero intra-amniotic delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing reagents during fetal development results in targeted and specific gene editing in fetal lungs. Pulmonary epithelial cells are predominantly targeted in this approach, with alveolar type 1, alveolar type 2, and airway secretory cells exhibiting high and persistent gene editing. We then used this in utero technique to evaluate a therapeutic approach to reduce the severity of the lethal interstitial lung disease observed in a mouse model of the human SFTPCI73T mutation. Embryonic expression of SftpcI73T alleles is characterized by severe diffuse parenchymal lung damage and rapid demise of mutant mice at birth. After in utero CRISPR-Cas9–mediated inactivation of the mutant SftpcI73T gene, fetuses and postnatal mice showed improved lung morphology and increased survival. These proof-of-concept studies demonstrate that in utero gene editing is a promising approach for treatment and rescue of monogenic lung diseases that are lethal at birth.',\n",

Frequent pornography use was associated with sexual dissatisfaction, greater preference for porn‐like sex, and more frequent masturbation in both studies.

The data did not support the notion that pornography negatively impacts sexual or relationship satisfaction via preference for porn‐like sex. In fact, it may bolster sexual satisfaction by promoting sexual variety.

Cross-sectional epidemiological studies, however, indicate lower prevalence of obesity among cannabis users. Here, we aim to study the weight-gain research question in the prospectively conducted National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC).\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nNESARC was designed to produce nationally representative estimates for the US population. Participants (aged 18+) completed computer-assisted personal interviews on cannabis use, body weight and height at Waves 1 (W1, 2001–02) and 2 (W2, 2004–05). General linear modelling yields estimates for change in body mass index (BMI) regressed on cannabis-use status, with covariate adjustment based on a conceptual model for BMI determinants (n\\u2009=\\u200933\\u2009000).\\n\\nResults\\n\\nAt W2, 77% of the participants never used cannabis, 18% had discontinued use (‘quit’), 3% were initiates and 2% were persistent users. Estimated W1-to-W2 BMI change shows an increase for all subgroups. Compared with never-users (reference), inverse slope estimates and attenuated change (%) in BMI between W1 and W2 are seen for cannabis-use subgroups: quitters [β\\u2009=\\u2009–0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI)\\u2009=\\u2009–1.01, –0.60], initiates (β\\u2009=\\u2009–0.97; 95% CI\\u2009=\\u2009–1.36, –0.57) and persistent users (β\\u2009=\\u2009–1.26; 95% CI\\u2009=\\u2009–1.81, –0.72).\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThis new prospective study builds from anecdotes, pre-clinical studies and cross-sectional evidence on inverse associations linking cannabis use and obesity and shows an inverse cannabis–BMI increase association.

The channel unexpectedly [let the comedian give the New Year 2019 Presidential speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjc4kcx8mlw) instead of the president.\\n\\nThere were journalist investigations showing that Zelensky\\'s (the comedian) company received money laundered by the oligarch Kolomoysky - about $41M ([google translate](https://translate.google.com.ua/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fkorrespondent.net%2Fukraine%2F4070812-arev-pokazal-skhemu-kak-yz-pryvatbanka-vyvely-41-mln)).\\n\\nIhor Kolomoysky used to own the by far biggest bank in the country - PrivatBank. It had to be nationalized a couple years ago. It turned out that a lot of money had been laundered out of the bank and it had to be refinanced by $5.5B, which is a crazy amount for such a poor country as Ukraine. The nationalization was scrutinized by IMF and got approved ([link](https://www.ft.com/content/81f6cd38-eadd-38d8-81e5-9e0f729345eb)). Major European governments expressed support for this decision as well.\\n\\nIhor Kolomoysky now wants a revenge as part of his assets were arrested and wants the case in the court of London against him to be dropped. A few days ago a Ukrainian court declared nationalizing of PrivatBank illegal. Looks like the bank will go back to the oligarch ([link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-privatbank/i-won-says-ukraine-tycoon-as-court-rules-privatbank-nationalization-illegal-idUSKCN1RU1KY)).\\n\\nWhenever asked about anything, Zelensky either gives vague non-answers or says \"we\\'ll do it somehow, I don\\'t know how\" or \"I\\'ll figure it out later\".

       " \"&gt;I awoke to the oxygen alarm in my space suit.  A steady, *obnoxious* beeping that eventually roused me from a deep and profound desire to just *fucking die.*  The storm had abated. I was face-down, almost totally buried in sand.  As I groggily came-to, I wondered why I wasn't more dead.  \\n\\n&gt;The antennae had enough force to punch through the suit and my side, but it had been stopped by my pelvis, so there was only one hole in the suit.  And a hole in *me*, of course.  I'd been knocked back quite a ways and rolled down a steep hill.  Somehow I landed face-down, which forced the antennae to a strongly-oblique angle that put a lot of torque on the hole in the suit.  It made a weak seal.  Then the copious blood my from wound trickled down toward the hole.\\n\\n&gt;As the blood reached the site of the breach the water in it quickly evaporated from the airflow and low pressure, leaving a gunky residue behind.  More blood came in behind it and was also reduced to gunk.  Eventually it sealed the gaps around the hole and reduced the leak to something the suit could counteract.\\n\\n&gt;The Suit did it's job admirably.  Sensing the drop in pressure, it constantly flooded itself with air from my nitrogen tank to equalize.  Once the leak became manageable, it only had to trickle new air in slowly to relieve the air lost.  After a while, the CO2 - carbon-dioxide - absorbers in the suit were expended.  That's really the limiting factor to life-support; not the amount of oxygen you bring with you, but the amount of CO2 you can remove.  In the H.A.B. I have the oxygenator - a large piece of equipment that breaks apart CO2 to give the oxygen back.  But the space suits have to be portable, so they use a simple chemical absorption process with expendable filters.  I'd been asleep long enough that my filters were useless.  \\n\\n&gt;The suit saw this problem and moved into an emergency mode the engineers called: *'bloodletting'*. Having no way to separate out the CO2, the suit deliberately vented air to the Martian atmosphere - then back-filled with nitrogen.  Between the breech and the blood-letting, it quickly ran out of nitrogen.  All it had left was my oxygen tank.  So, it did the only thing it could to keep me alive.  It started back-filled with pure oxygen.  I now risk dying from *oxygen toxicity,* as the excessively high amount of oxygen threatened to burn up my nervous system, lungs, and eyes.  An ironic death for someone with a leaky spacesuit - too much oxygen.\\n\\n-*Mark Watney*, Opening to *The Martian* by Andy Weir\\n\\n\\nIncidentally,\\n\\n&gt;Warning: *Low Oxygen*\\n\\n--Mark Watney's suit in the movie *The Martian*.\",\n",
       " \"This was an interesting topic I read in school called the hypoxic drive. Think of holding your breath then needing the urge to breathe. In healthy people this urge is signalled to you by chemoreceptors because of the buildup of CO2, not the lack of oxygen. Breathing pure oxygen for extended periods can result in nitrogen washout that causes lung collapse. Nitrogen is what holds the lung alveoli open.\\n\\nSome examples of this hypoxic drive was noted in some drownings by experienced swimmers called shallow water blackout. A simple trick of hyperventilating will allow the swimmer to expel extra CO2 resulting in a longer time underwater because it takes a longer time of CO2 to buildup causing the urge to breathe. Since the swimmer is actively using up oxygen by swimming, they eventually passout due to the lack of it but don't notice it because the chemoreceptors respond to CO2.\\n\\nThe above isn't the case for people who have COPD (chronic obstructive lung disease), in some terms they are also known as CO2 retainers since they have higher levels of it. With these people their chemoreceptors will eventually respond to the lack of oxygen instead of high CO2 since they chronically have high levels of it. Breathing pure oxygen will signal their receptors that their body does not need to breathe anymore since their is an abundance of oxygen. \\n\\nDavid Blaine did a feat of this when he stayed underwater for a long time. I think he did a video interview where he said he was training with Navy SEALs on breathstacking and hyperventilating. He was very still underwater to not use oxygen and build CO2. \\n\\nTry at your own risk and time breath holds with and without hyperventilating. Breathe deep in and out about 10x then hold your breath. \\n\\nStop hyperventilating if you get light headed, your lips and fingers tingle or just feel weird. LoL\",\n",

A successful appeal requires a decisive two-thirds majority affirming that the rating is “clearly erroneous.” The overriding objective of the appeals process is to ensure that the rating system remains consistent and therefore credible. The Board reviews 800-900 films each year.

It is, of course, no secret that both of these boys were profoundly troubled, but to say that *nobody listened to them* (which some could interpret as if listening alone would have saved the lives of 12 students and 1 teacher, as well as the lives of the shooters) is just simply false. When I hear this, I think of how certain people blamed the [computer games](https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/10/17101232/a-brief-history-of-video-game-violence-blame) that they played or the [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Manson%E2%80%93Columbine_High_School_massacre_controversy) that they listened to, and how dangerous it is to simplify such a complicated subject. I am a fan of Michael Moore, as well as Marilyn Manson, but this documentary from 2002 **is not the final word on the Columbine Massacre.** I suppose that nobody is arguing that it is, but if the above statement is going to be posted (not just on Reddit) as often as it is, I believe that there should be more to the conversation. \\n\\nIf you are interested in a deeper dive on Columbine, the perpetrators, the survivors, the time period, response and aftermath, there is a lot to discover. The book [Columbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_(book) by Dave Cullen is quite good and very informative and illuminating. I\\'ll also link an article to [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/keeping-kids-safe/200905/columbine-bullying-and-the-mind-eric-harris) regarding Eric Harris. Here is an article from [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/columbine-shooters-motives-2018-2) , as well as a [Ted Talk by Sue Klebold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXlnrFpCu0c) that I believe is worth a listen. The above links are only, of course, the first few steps into the rabbit hole. There is a lot to learn and still to be learned, I believe. \\n\\nAlso, just in case somebody is not aware, today is the 20th anniversary of the massacre.\\n\\nEdit: u/vorpalrobot made the [correct point](https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/bfegt7/its_the_20th_anniversary_of_the_columbine/eldm3fg/) regarding my comment, and that the question from Michael Moore was **\"If you could talk directly to the kids at Columbine, and the community, what would you say?\"** which is the opposite of what I was responding to. I suppose that I have just seen this clip, quotes from this clip (used correctly and incorrectly), as well as many myths about the massacre, posted so many times that I myself forgot to listen, *making me a guilty party*. Mr. Manson\\'s answer is clear and poignant and he is not spreading falsehoods.

Having a sound mixing alternative rock with elements of metal, punk music, and more, the band consists of Dryden Mitchell (vocals, guitar), Terry Corso (guitar), Tye Zamora (bass) and Mike Cosgrove (drums). Taking their name from the popular sci-fi trope of aliens having created humanity for their own amusement, the band became internationally famous in 2001 for two smash hits: \"Movies\" and \"Smooth Criminal\" (a spirited rock cover of the Michael Jackson tune).\\n\\n&gt; In 1999, the band released their debut album, the tongue-in-cheek titled \\'Greatest Hits\\'. It went on to win \"Best Independent Album\" in the L.A. Music Awards and has picked up a big fan response. In 2000, after forging a friendship with the alternative rock band Papa Roach, Alien Ant Farm signed with DreamWorks SKG for their first major studio album, called \\'ANThology\\'. The band\\'s tunes showcased an energetic sound that featured humorous, often cynical lyrics and a desire to take in all kinds of musical influences.\\n\\n&gt; In 2001, their cover of the Michael Jackson song, \"Smooth Criminal\", was a #1 single in both Australia and New Zealand as well a #3 single in the United Kingdom and #1 on Billboard\\'s Modern Rock chart. The song\\'s music video features numerous homages to Michael Jackson\\'s life and career as well as Jackson\\'s many videos. The song was featured on the soundtrack of the first season of \\'WWE Tough Enough\\' and in the movie \\'American Pie 2\\'. Their following single, \"Movies\", also featured a quirky music video with references to classic films such as \\'The Karate Kid\\' and \\'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\'. The tune became top 5 hit in the U.K. and a top 20 hit in New Zealand. The band began touring in promotion of these two singles and their album, which later went platinum.\\n\\n&gt; In spring of 2002, the band contributed the track \"Bug Bytes\" to the first \\'Spider-Man\\' soundtrack, giving them even more exposure after the Tobey Maguire film\\'s major success. However, tragedy struck the group. In May 2002, the band was involved in a bus accident while touring in Spain. The driver, 26-year-old Christopher Holland, was killed, and lead singer Dryden Mitchell suffered a fractured C2 vertebra. The horrific event scarred the group permanently, and many fans speculated that the band might have to go on a long hiatus or even fold for a while.\\n\\n&gt; Nontheless, Alien Ant Farm soon returned to the studio to work on their next album, titled \\'truANT\\', which was released in 2003. Produced by Stone Temple Pilots\\' Robert and Dean DeLeo, the work found the band doubling down on their past style. The video for \"These Days\", the first single from the album, was filmed on top of a nearby building during the Red Carpet at the 2003 BET Awards. While that tune ended up having more modest success that the band had hoped, song \"Glow\" was a mainstream radio success, achieving long lasting Top 20 success in New Zealand. Two months after this album was released, however, the group\\'s record label closed its doors. Some fans speculated that the outfit had some kind of black cloud of bad luck around them, despite the guys\\' talents.\\n\\n&gt; In October 2003, guitarist Terry Corso split with the band, citing \"irreconcilable differences\". Soon after, he joined the popular alternative metal outfit Powerman 5000 for a time. Joe Hill was named the new guitarist in 2005. The musician had formerly served in the underground California rock outfit Spiderworks.\\n\\n&gt; In 2004, the band recorded the song \"Dark in Here\" for the Punisher video game. Unfortunately, the band was forced to wait for Geffen to allow them to record another album. Label Universal Music had bought DreamWorks and assigned the band to the Geffen Records company, and it appeared as if corporate shenanigans had stopped the band\\'s momentum in its tracks, the mainstream popularity having faded.\\n\\n&gt; In 2005, the band recorded with producer Jim Wirt (who recorded their independent, debut release \"Greatest Hits\") and planned to release the album during that summer. However, Geffen shelved the album and subsequently denied the band the rights to release it themselves. The band hit the road and made bootleg copies of the album material available to all of their fans. This unofficial release was dubbed 3rd Draft by fans.\\n\\n&gt; In late 2005, Geffen finally agreed to let the band release the album on another Universal label, Universal Music Enterprises (its catalogue division). On May 4, 2006, information began showing up on music store websites and release calendars about an upcoming release from the band. The band also released information about a DVD that same day. On May 30, 2006 the new album, Up in the Attic, was released digitally on iTunes. The first single was \"Forgive and Forget\", the one added track to 3rd Draft.\\n\\n&gt; In April 2006, bassist Tye Zamora left the band and decided to go to college. He was replaced by Alex Barreto (formerly of hardcore bands Chain of Strength, Hardstance, and Inside Out). On June 29, 2006, the band performed on G4\\'s Attack of the Show, and on July 18, 2006, Up in the Attic was released worldwide, along with BUSted: The Definitive DVD. Included on the DVD were music videos for \"Forgive and Forget\", \"Around the Block\", and \"She\\'s Only Evil\". Notably, the three videos feature only Dryden Mitchell and Mike Cosgrove.\\n\\n&gt; Since the July 2006 release of Up in the Attic, very little has happened. Their website remained unupdated from November 2006 until April 2007, the update promoting the Alien Ant Fans website, created by a long time Polish fan, Bartek.\\n\\n&gt; The band released Around the Block, the second single from Up in the Attic, on iTunes Store in 2007.\\n\\n&gt; On February 11, 2008, the band posted a statement on their website saying all the original members of the band are back together. It was also revealed that the band had \"unofficially broken up\" in 2007 due to the fact that 2006\\'s Up in the Attic was their least successful album. Four shows have been announced on their website for April and May.

       " 'I wanted the to explain how Avicii changed music, he was a great musician and a artist,  this is my perspective as a musician, listener and fan. Its starts with the state of electronic music before Avicii arrived. So I apologize for the back story.\\n\\nAvicii was one Artist, who had a lot of talent and I always respected musically.  I make electronic and call it computer music myself; and so naturally, I still listen and I have always listened to electronic and all its classifications and variants. So Electronic dance music was coming out of a drought or hangover from the 1990\\'s- 2000s scene.  But in 2008 electronic dance music started to make a reappearance.  Fyi..electronic music was being kept alive and the scene during this period  2003- 2007 mainly in France, UK (there was almost nothing on the radio being aired or in the clubs and nothing to download really from napster, kazza and then apple music, in the US, no one listened to it anymore)  This doesn\\'t mean that producers and dj\\'s weren\\'t making music like Eric Prydz \"call on me\").  In 2008 there were interesting songs, DJ\\'s doing there own thing, hit or miss stuff.  I started listening to Pete Tong\\'s Radio 1 show. So Pete Tong plays this artist, really catchy raw song, Avicii\\'s earliest stuff, I liked it reminded me of my style. So then some of you may remember Avicii released a song called \"Ryu\" which was his take, to musically challenge other artists and musically recreate Ryu the character from the game Street Fighter with a Keygen(application crack) sound, not only was the song a banger, you could tell he was different. Because there was soul and heart in his electronic music, which a lot of electronic music did not have, until then it was pretty soulless, maybe besides Dead Maus, not really. Also Ryu was very refined.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMUnvEX9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMUnvEX9s)  \\\\- Avicii Ryu 2009\\n\\nI would say more EDM artists started gravitating to Avicii style in 2009 2010,  he crystallized and help define the EDM sound. To where Swedish House Mafia, Pryda and all the popular DJs, even up to today like ABGT, are influenced in some way by Avicii.\\n\\nAvicii went further with Levels, I heard the original, before the vocals, and it blew up, and Pete Tong recommended he copy right it, form a label and release it while on air. Avicii said it was an idea, after he added the vocal, \"I got a good feeling\" which made the song so soulful, for that time, he really took electronic to a different level and that\\'s what made him popular bringing him in center of EDM in 2010, 2011. By then dubstep  and the whole scene was taking off, there was a defined sound, cohesive in EDM and that included dubstep, one could say the sound of a generation.\\n\\nEveryone knows Silhouettes and that song took the genre further, and really alot of EDM even up until today still has constructs of that song, it heavily influenced all EDM and it was deep also, highly soulful, its what he did and defined him as an artist.\\n\\nAvicii kept releasing songs further defining EDM and changing music in general.\\n\\nSo then I think at Miami Ultra in 2013 or 2014 festival, which has been going on for decades now. He played \"Wake me up\" and he got boo\\'ed and the sentiment was; what is this song? country music.  The song is one of my favorites, it ended up blowing up, becoming his most popular song and the cross over EDM song, to where Coldplay and other major music artists where coming to him to produce songs on their album. And wake me up again changed and influenced electronic music.\\n\\nHe came down with his illness and took a break, but still came back and further pushed the limits of EDM and refined music in general.\\n\\nI had the opportunity in 2009 to go to a small venue, no more then 50 people in a downtown club in orlando fl, to see him. I knew who he was as an artist then and I was looking forward to hear him spin, this was before he became popular. I didn\\'t make it down that night, and I will forever regret it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn short: Avicii crystallized and help define the EDM sound. kept pushing the genre, became more soulful in his music or it made you think, then he became at one point; Musics top musician, and crossed over the electronic music sound to where it was main stream.',\n",

       " '**ZZ Top**  \\n [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/13ce8c2996724637aef52636d19cb361.png)  \\n\\n&gt; ZZ Top is an American rock trio formed in 1969 in Houston, Texas. The band has, since 1970, consisted of bassist/vocalist Dusty Hill, vocalist/guitarist Billy Gibbons (the band\\'s leader, main lyricist and musical arranger), and drummer Frank Beard. \"As genuine roots musicians, they have few peers\", according to critic Michael \"Cub\" Koda. \"Gibbons is one of America\\'s finest blues guitarists working in the arena rock idiom [...] while Hill and Beard provide the ultimate rhythm section support.\"\\n\\n&gt; The band released its first album—called ZZ Top\\'s First Album—in 1971. Beginning with blues-inspired rock, the trio later incorporated new wave, punk rock and dance-rock by using synthesizers. Their songs have a reputation for containing humorous lyrics laced with double entendres and innuendo.\\n\\n&gt; The band\\'s top-selling album is their 1983 release Eliminator, which sold more than 10 million copies in the United States. Total record sales of 25 million place ZZ Top among the top-100-selling artists in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. That includes 11 gold, seven platinum and three multi-platinum records as of 2016, according to the RIAA. By 2014, ZZ Top had sold more than 50 million albums worldwide.\\n\\n&gt; ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004.\\n\\n&gt; The original line-up was formed in Houston and consisted of Gibbons, bassist/organist Lanier Greig (died February 2013) and drummer Dan Mitchell. The name of the band was Gibbons\\' idea. The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers\\' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed B.B. King and Z.Z. Hill and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is going at the top\" which brought him to \"ZZ Top\".\\n\\n&gt; ZZ Top was managed by Bill Ham, a Waxahachie, Texas native, who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick\", in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller\\'s Farm\". Both songs were credited to Gibbons. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick\", Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Mitchell was replaced by Frank Beard of the American Blues. Due to lack of interest from U.S. record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from London Records. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and Dusty Hill was selected as his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Beaumont, Texas, on February 10.\\n\\n&gt; In addition to assuming the role as the band\\'s leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ZZ Top\\'s First Album (1971) was released and exhibited the band\\'s humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top\\'s blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released Rio Grande Mud (1972), which failed commercially and the promotional tour consisted of mostly empty auditoriums.\\n\\n&gt; In addition to recording and performing concerts, ZZ Top has also been involved with films and television. In 1990, the group appeared as the \"band at the party\" in the film Back to the Future Part III, and played the \"Three Men in a Tub\" in the movie Mother Goose Rock \\'n\\' Rhyme. ZZ Top made further appearances, including the \"Gumby with a Pokey\" episode of Two and a Half Men in 2010[48] and the \"Hank Gets Dusted\" episode of King of the Hill in 2007. The band was also guest hosts on an episode of WWE Raw. Billy Gibbons also has a recurring role as the father of Angela Montenegro in the television show Bones; though the character is never named, it is strongly implied that Gibbons is playing himself. Their song \"Sharp Dressed Man\" was one of the theme songs used for the television show Duck Dynasty, and on the series finale of the show they appeared with Si Robertson as a vocalist to perform the song on stage during Robertson\\'s retirement party. Black Dahlia Films, led by Jamie Burton Chamberlin, of Seattle and Los Angeles, has contributed documentaries and back line screen work (the footage on back screens during live shows) and has become an integral part of the band\\'s film-making. ZZ Top made a guest appearance on the television show St. Elsewhere on November 14, 1984 Season 3 Episode 8 \"Sweet Dreams\" in Luther\\'s dream. While the band appears in Luther\\'s dream, once Luther wakes he finds the \"Z\" keychain in the lock of the door to the room he was sleeping in. \\n\\n&gt; ZZ Top\\'s music videos won awards throughout the 1980s, winning once each in the categories Best Group Video, Best Direction, and Best Art Direction. The videos that won the VMAs are \"Legs\", \"Sharp Dressed Man\" and \"Rough Boy\". Some of the high honors ZZ Top have achieved include induction into Hollywood\\'s RockWalk in 1994, the Texas House of Representatives naming them \"Official Heroes for the State of Texas\", a declaration of \"ZZ Top Day\" in Texas by then-governor Ann Richards on May 4, 1991, and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. They were also given commemorative rings by actor Billy Bob Thornton from the VH1 Rock Honors in 2007.\\n\\n&gt; ZZ Top also holds several chart and album sales feats, including six number-one singles on the Mainstream Rock chart. From the RIAA, ZZ Top has achieved four gold, three platinum and two multiple-platinum album certifications, in addition to one diamond album. In addition to this, many of their songs have been in regular rotation on classic rock and hard rock radio stations.

They were one of the leading members of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) and are acknowledged by later bands like Metallica and Megadeth as an important early influence.\\n\\n&gt; Formed by school friends Tatler and Harris, the band recorded and released self-financed demo tapes in 1977 and 1979 and with their unique sound and quality of song writing gained enough attention to tour as support with AC/DC and Iron Maiden. A clutch of record companies fought to sign the band, while their first album, variously known as \" The White Album\" or Lightning to the Nations, was released by the band via mail-order only in 1980 by their own Happy Face Records. Each plain label LP featured the signature of one or other of the band members and has become on of the most sought after collector items from the time. Its success finally led to a record deal with MCA Records in 1981. The first major label LP Borrowed Time was enthusiastically received ( getting to #24 in the UK album charts), although the more experimental follow-up Canterbury, in 1983 suffered pressing problems and criticism over the progressive direction. Stalling creatively, the band split up for the first time in 1985.\\n\\n&gt; In 1991 Tatler and Harris reformed Diamond Head. The same year Sean Harris (the vocalist) worked on a song with Dave Mustaine for Megadeth called \"Crown Of Worms\" - it was unreleased but would feature on the remastered version of Countdown to Extinction. In 1993, featuring contributions by Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath and Dave Mustaine of Megadeth the band released Death and Progress. In 1994 the band split again and did not reform until 2002. During which time they did a tour with Megadeth, who\\'d also re-formed after Mustaine had recovered enough to be able to play guitar again. After news of work on a new album, fans were surprised to hear of the departure of Sean Harris in 2004 and his replacement by Nick Tart. Brian Tatler is now the only ever-present member in the Diamond Head line-up. The band\\'s latest album, All Will Be Revealed, was released in 2005, but was very different from their early material.\\n\\n&gt; Diamond Head are probably most famous among heavy metal fans for their influence on Metallica. Metallica acknowledge them as a very important early influence and have often covered Diamond Head songs at gigs. Harris was even asked to join Metallica in the 1980\\'s but turned the band down. The song Helpless was rumored to be a song Lars Ulrich forced the band to struggle through as an unrehearsed encore in the early days of their formation. Sucking My Love, Am I Evil and The Prince were also common live covers at that time. The earliest known actual recording of these songs exists as a rehearsal demo recorded at then-bassist Ron McGovney\\'s house in March of 1982. The Metal Up Your Ass live demo, recorded in November of that year, featured a live rendition of Am I Evil. The Prince was also played, but the tape ran out too soon to catch it. The song would see another demo release as part of the Horsemen Of The Apocalypse demo in 1983. Sucking My Love exists on various bootlegs that have been circulating since 1982 along with a recording on the early demo \\'No Life Til Leather\\'.\\n\\n&gt; The first official release of Am I Evil came in 1983 as part of the Creeping Death EP, paired with another NWOBHM classic Blitzkrieg, by the band of the same name. The two songs were also included in the first pressing of the Kill \\'Em All LP when it was re-released by Elektra Records.\\n\\n&gt; Helpless would see a proper release with Garage Days Re-Revisited in 1987, and The Prince was included as a B-side to the Harvester Of Sorrow single.\\n\\n&gt; The official recordings of Helpless, Am I Evil, and The Prince would also be featured on Metallica\\'s 2-CD Garage Inc. compilation, a collection of numerous other cover songs that the band had played over the years.

The first album on which The Revolution performed was the 1982 Prince release, 1999, which has the band's moniker written in reverse on the back cover. \\n\\n&gt; When the 1999 Tour ended in 1983, Dez Dickerson left the band for religious reasons and was replaced by Lisa's childhood friend and soon-to-be lover Wendy Melvoin on guitar. The first album officially released as Prince &amp; The Revolution was Purple Rain in 1984, which sold over 16 million copies in the United States alone. \\n\\n&gt; The band's sound incorporated heavy metal, pop, funk, R&amp;B and hard rock elements. Wendy Melvoin &amp; Lisa Coleman formed a particular creative bond with Prince and greatly influenced the band's output during the rest of their tenure. The band achieved two number-one Billboard 200 albums (Purple Rain &amp; Around The World In A Day), six top ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and won three Grammy Awards. \\n\\n&gt; In 1985, members of the soon-to-be-defunct group The Family (which, in turn, included former members of another group, The Time) joined The Revolution, along with people from Sheila E.'s band. This included the addition of three dancers/vocalists/comic foils (known as The Bodyguards).\\n\\n&gt; The last lineup of Prince &amp; the Revolution was informally known as the Counter-Revolution and consisted of:\\n\\n&gt; - Jerome Benton (The Bodyguards)\\n- Atlanta Bliss (trumpet)\\n- Greg Brooks (The Bodyguards)\\n- Lisa Coleman (keyboards, piano and vocals)\\n- Doctor Fink (keyboards and vocals)\\n- Eric Leeds (saxophone)\\n- Brown Mark (bass guitar and vocals)\\n- Susannah Melvoin (backing vocals)\\n- Wendy Melvoin (guitar and vocals)\\n- Prince (lead vocals, guitar, and piano)\\n- Wally Safford (The Bodyguards)\\n- Miko Weaver (guitar)\\n- Bobby Z. (drums)\\n\\n&gt; The Revolution was officially disbanded by Prince in 1986 after the Hit N Run tour, which supported Parade, the soundtrack for the movie Under the Cherry Moon. Melvoin and Coleman went on to a successful career as Wendy &amp; Lisa.
